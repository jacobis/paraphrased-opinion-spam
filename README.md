Paraphrased OPinion Spam (POPS) Corpus v1.0
===========================================

Overview

For our POPS dataset, we have paid attention to the tendency that spammers often reference already written truthful reviews. Thus, we aimed to create a paraphrased dataset of 400 deceptive positive sentiment reviews using AMT Turkers. For the given task of creating POPS through AMT, we gave Turkers reviews of specific hotels and then provided guidelines for paraphrasing the given reviews that contain factual information of a hotel and real opinions and feelings of actual visitors of the hotel.
