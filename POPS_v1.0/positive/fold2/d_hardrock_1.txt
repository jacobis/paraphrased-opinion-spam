Love the Hard Rock on Michigan Ave!  The first thing you notice is the themed decor - really interesting, better than the boring mass-produced stuff in a lot of hotels.  The rooms are good - plenty of space, comfy beds, sweet bathrooms with Aveda products.  You can't beat the location, especially for this price, and the service is really wonderful - the concierge staff go out of their way to help you with directions or any little requests you have.  Definitely recommend.
