Our stay at the Talbott was fantastic from start to finish. The location provided easy access to the attractions on State, Rush, and North Michigan which was a huge plus for my family visiting the city for the first time- not to mention the beautiful views from and around the hotel. The rooms are spacious and the beds are among the most comfortable I have slept in. The staff was always attentive of our needs and quick to respond to any of our requests. The room was always fresh and ready when we returned from a long day in the city. Some other niceties included free internet, a quaint outdoor courtyard and very nice ambiance in the main lobby. I will definitely be staying here again!
