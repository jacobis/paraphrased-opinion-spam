The Hard Rock Hotel, located on Michigan Avenue, is close to most everything you'll want and need. From public transportation, Grant Park, The Art Institute and shops on Michigan Avenue -- you'll be close to it all. Check-in was a breeze through the helpful staff and the room was clean, comfortable, cozy and quiet. The king sized bed was plush with fantastic Aveda products and bathrobe in the bathroom. The first day I checked out the gym which was a nice bonus. The remaining days of my stay I took a run through nearby Grant Park.
