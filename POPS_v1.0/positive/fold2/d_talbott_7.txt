We stayed at this wonderful hotel for two nights. Since we required a handicapped accessible room one was provided for us at a reasonable cost. The view from the balcony was beautiful and showed off the city at night. The location was perfect. All the main sight seeing places were of walking distance so my spouse could use his scooter. Despite the upcoming construction we were more then able to get around. There were a variety of food choices in the walls of the hotel which provided a free breakfast each morning. There were also small shops to shop at. We would use this hotel again just to enjoy the wonderful service all the staff provided for our stay.
