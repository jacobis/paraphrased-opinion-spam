This hotel has really stood the test of time. While it's not a brand spanking new Hilton Hotel in the middle of the city, its charms, location and history more than make up for any modernistic wants. The building is beautiful both on the inside-the lobby, guest rooms, but also the outside. Located in a less trafficked Chicago neighborhood, the grime of the city doesn't touch this remarkable building. You can tell that there is a lot of care taken in the full experience of the hotel. Everything is presented in a clean, homey, charming way, especially the guest bedrooms. They may look like they are from a different time, that's because they are! But nonetheless, it adds to the vibe of this wonderful place. The owners and staff of this hotel obviously take pride in what they do, and it is much appreciated. The service and additional amenities are far above par, and even the food is something you would expect out of a fine dining restaurant, not a hotel kitchen.
