The Affinia is for all intents and purposes the ideal lodging for a visit to Chicago. My room was enormous, restroom was extensive and in perfect working order, bed was flawless and the view was astonishing. The room was spotless and clean, all through. The Attendant Christopher was fantastic; he assisted with everything we needed, gave us markdown vouchers and so on. Great food, friendly staff, vast clean rooms, agreeable beds, just adjacent to the Golden Mile area. The cost is quite reasonable for what you get. We essentially couldn't discover anything to complain about. Exceptionally recommended!
