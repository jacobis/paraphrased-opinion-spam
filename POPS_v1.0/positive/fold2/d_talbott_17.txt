Our stay at the Talbott hotel was a memorable one for us in Chicago. The room was not only beautiful and but was also at a location that we requested. The nearby construction did not bother our sleep the slightest bit thanks to the room location. The bath room was a special and unexpected feature of the room, the tub had whirlpool which had an MP3 compatible radio making our time in the tub more enjoyable. Breakfast at the Basil cafe let us started our day full of energy to explore Chicago. Dinner was at a restaurant that was magnificently picked by the concierge, Stephanie. She also put in a bonus of free appetizer for us. Next time we are in Chicago staying at the Talbott hotel is a must since it is right in the heart of downtown Chicago, right next to Michigan avenue.
