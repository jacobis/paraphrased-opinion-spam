I recently stayed at The Ambassador East, located in the Gold Coast neighborhood in Chicago. The location truly gives a neighborhood, welcoming feel. The hotel is conveniently located near shopping, restaurants, and has easy access to the train and bus. This was helpful for me as I did not have my own transportation. I found the rate for the room to be very affordable, especially considering the location. The restaurants and shops nearby were also in my price range. There is also access to good food and a bar right inside the hotel. The hotel had an old time feel to it, which was a nice change and made my stay more comfortable. I would definitely recommend a stay at The Ambassador East and would stay here again.
