This Hotel is really something special. I initially came to Chicago because of business, but I booked extra days so I could have a vacation too. When I got there I was not in the best mood at all. It was busy in the lobby and i had just gotten off of a plane. Despite all that, service was extremely quick and i got to mine room happy. I ordered room service that night because I was so tired, and it arrived hot and as tasty as a restaurant. The next day I had my meeting, but I couldn't locate it on a map, so I asked the service for help, and one of the employees drove me to my meeting, free of charge! He said it was "just part of the service for the hotel"! I was really happy with that. Later that night after my meeting, I went to the red light district. I have to say this hotel is in the perfect location. It is only 3 blocks away from the nightlife and downtown, but it is far enough away that it is not loud. SO i went to the red light district and had a great time! The next morning i ate hotel breakfast, and it wasn't very cheap, but the dining area was nice. It felt genuine like a small town place, in this big city of Chicago. I stayed a couple more days and had a blast! all in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. It is a great place to stay.
