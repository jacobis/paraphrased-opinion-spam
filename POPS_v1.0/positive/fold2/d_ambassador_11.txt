I stayed two nights at the Ambassador East Hotel. Looking for a comfortable place to stay while on a business trip to Chicago, I am proud to say I found this gem. Located in a perfect location, easy access to restaurants, short walk to the magnificent mile,  and the train station isn't too far. Not to mention the staff was unbelievably friendly and very helpful. The hotel has been around for a while so be warned, but all in all it is very clean and convenient.
