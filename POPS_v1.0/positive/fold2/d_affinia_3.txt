My husband and I stayed at the new Affinia Hotel. for the first time last month. The hotel that we stayed at had the best customer service that we have experienced in a very long time. In addition to that, the condition of the hotel was immaculate. The hallways and social areas were clean and comfortable. The room was very fresh and inviting. With all of the attractions around that we wanted to visit, we were excited knowing that they were all within a reasonable distance. Our stay at the Affinia was a wonderful surprise. We will definitely be back again.
