I recently stayed at the Talbott with my husband on a weekend get away.  We absolutely loved it!  Not only was the location great for our trip, but the hotel staff were all so accommodating.  I was able to go do all the shopping I wanted to with ease because the hotel was so close to all the shops I wanted to visit.  My husband was able to visit many different bars during the night life since he sees himself as a beer connoisseur. When we needed to go somewhere out of walking distance the concierge were more than happy to make us reservations and line up transportation for us.  The doorman was always there to greet us and help with our bags.  On top of all that the rooms were fantastic!  They were very spacious for a smaller hotel and the Queen size bed was extremely comfortable.  We had no trouble falling asleep in this cozy room, plus there was free wifi.  So all in all it was a great trip and I would definitely recommend the Talbott to all my friends.
