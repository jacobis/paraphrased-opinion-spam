What a great hotel! The rooms are luxurious, very spacious, and very comfortable to stay in. There are so many things to do very close to the hotel that you will never get bored. I loved seeing all the sites and night life. Transportation is very cheap and most things are in walking distance. The service at the hotel is above average and they are willing to help you with anything you need. Very fast and efficient. The food is one of the best parts as it is gourmet and one of a kind. A very pleasant stay at this hotel.
