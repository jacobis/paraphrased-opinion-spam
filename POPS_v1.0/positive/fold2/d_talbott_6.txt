This is a great hotel with large, renovated rooms. The location is fantastic and is near many sight-seeing spots on Michigan Avenue, as well as public transportation. The staff are very helpful and friendly. They provide free wi-fi which is very convenient, and you can use the gym next to the hotel for free. I look forward to my next stay.
