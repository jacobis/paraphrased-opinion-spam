I really recommend the Talbott hotel due to its great location, friendly staff and spacious rooms.  The hotel is ideally located in a very central area. A wide variety of stores and dining options are just steps away from the hotel. There are a number of nightlife options in the immediate vicinity as well. The entire staff is extremely welcoming, knowledgeable and courteous.  From the moment of reaching the doorman and concierge, the staff goes out of their way to make sure all guests are taken care of and all of their needs are met. Guestrooms in the Talbott are spacious, with comfortable bedding and large bathrooms.  Rooms have free wireless connections, which is a definite advantage over many other options. Based on the location, staff and rooms, the Talbott is highly recommended for your future stay.
