We stayed at the Hard Rock  because we got an excellent deal through the website. The rooms were clean and the decor was fantastic. Not plain or boring at all! We were able to get to the mall nearby to shop easily, and to get to our convention on foot. The hotel itself was clean and beautiful, and the staff was helpful. Our schedule was so packed that we thought we wouldn't spend much time in the hotel on this trip but we ended up coming back early just because it was so comfortable.
