The Hard Rock cafe is a fantastic hotel in a terrific location right off of Michigan Ave. The room was very trendy and clean and the staff were fantastic. The hotel is surrounded by a ton of great restaurants and the bar inside the hotel was great as well. For the price I do not think you can find a better hotel with a great location and rooms.
