The Ambassador was wonderful! I really enjoyed my stay: great view, great staff, and wonderful workout area. The price wasn't to shabby either which was a major plus for me. The staff was great, making my stay comfortable and enjoyable: it's the little things that count, such as extra towels and even appliances if requested at no charge. I will most definitely be returning here in the near future!
