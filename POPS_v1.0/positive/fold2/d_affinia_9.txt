The Affinia is a wonderful  hotel in Chicago. Almost everything about it hits a high note -- location, view, staff, cleanliness. It is located in the heart of downtown Chicago, with easy access to all of the tourist sites one may want to visit. Since parking is expensive, it makes sense to leave the car in a remote lot and hike around. It is close to major shopping such as Neiman Marcus as well as the Hancock Tower, the Magnificent Mile, and the lake. One of the best features of this place is the friendliness of the staff -- always willing to help or answer a question. The hotel has nice amenities too -- an on-site pub and a rooftop bar. Just be sure to ask about the free breakfast as they might not mention its availability. A suggestion is to upgrade one's stay to a suite as this is like a mini "home away from home" with the feel of a small apartment rather than a hotel room. One caveat -- they are in the process of remodeling, probably with the thought in mind of appealing to a more upscale clientele, so prices may rise substantially once the work is done.
