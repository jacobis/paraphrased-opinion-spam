The Ambassador East is a hotel located just a few blocks away from the train station, residential, business, and shopping/food center of Gold Coast neighborhood in Chicago. It's also within walking distance from a vast array of restaurants ( 50+) and has a nice Cafe just down the street for early morning jogs. Spending less than 100$ a night allows us to shop more up the street on North Michigan Ave. We usually pick this National Historic Landmark Hotel over others, the large clean rooms are reasonably priced and their lobby is decorated with nicely.
