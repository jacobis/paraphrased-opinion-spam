Just spent a weekend at the Affinia Chicago and wanted to write a review while the details were still fresh in my mind. The location is hard to beat, close to major areas like Millenium Station (2 miles) and Michigan Avenue. Although there was some stuff undergoing repair in the lobby, the people were all extremely friendly and helpful. After showing us to our room, we were informed that we had a choice of 8 different pillows! Seems like a small gesture now, but at the time we were bowled away. The rooms are spacious and you can tell that a lot of effort was put into makign it feel cozy. The view was great, the bed was comfortable, and the furnishings made us feel fancy even though we weren't paying much. We will definitely be back to visit!
