It was our first stay at Affinia, and we'll be back. The bed was great so we got a good nights sleep. The room was clean and spacious so we didn't feel cramped and were able to settle in and relax. The bathroom was updated and very clean with plenty of soft towels. The location was good as well, we were able to easily go everywhere we wanted with no problem. The hotel staff was polite, knowlegable and clean.
