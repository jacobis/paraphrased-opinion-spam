The hotel Ambassador met and exceeded expectations. The bedding was well kept and perfectly neat as expected. It came with wifi which was wonderful because I needed to do a bit of work while I stayed there. The price was to be expected but did not charge extra for the little extra things such as towels or breakfast. What really threw it over the top was the location and the service. The service was polite, quick and did their job perfectly. The location was near everything I was wanting and needing to go without much travel to and from.
