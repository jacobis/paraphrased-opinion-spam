This was a perfect hotel to book on vacation - the front desk was very helpful and helped us plan our route around town, and the aesthetic was very elegant for the prices. Rooms were sizable and the bathrooms were roomy and stocked with necessities. Was an overall quiet stay with no drama, and the room service arrived piping-hot and delicious! Would absolutely book a room here again.
