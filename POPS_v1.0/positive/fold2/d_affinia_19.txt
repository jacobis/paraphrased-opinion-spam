I was surprised to find this hotel in such a beautiful location. Not only the location was great but the prices were affordable. They had available parking, so checking-in was fast. They had great customer service. Such a great staff. I got the room key and I was shocked that they had great big rooms. They also provide free WiFi and HBO! Great time and worth every penny.
