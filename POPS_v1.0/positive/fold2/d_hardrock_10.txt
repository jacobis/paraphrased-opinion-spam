Had a great experience staying at the Hard Rock in Chicago! Stayed there for a a couple of nights for a getaway with my girlfriends and we really enjoyed the hotel. The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful and out rocker themed room was a good size for the three of us to stay in. The view from the room was amazing and we could see lots of downtown Chicago. There was a cool bar in the hotel that we had drinks at every night before we headed out on the town. The location was perfect for what we wanted to do- go out and explore the city! There were places in walking distance to go, but it was also really easy to grab a cheap cab when we didn't want to talk or use public transportation. Would definitely stay here again!
