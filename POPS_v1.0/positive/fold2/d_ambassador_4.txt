It is rare that I have an experience that is so sublime from start to finish as the one I just had at the Ambassador East.  From the very moment I got there, I knew that I was in good hands.  The checkin process was easy and the staff incredibly courteous throughout.  There were little things that made everything special, like the flowers in the lobby.  The rooms were fine, perhaps older with some distress, but honestly, it just added to the sense of history and charm.  This is, after all, the place with the historic Pump Room.  We were close enough to walk to the Hancock building and other land marks we wanted to be sure to visit.  Oh!  And they offered me a FREE SUV service to a meeting I had in the loop.   A fantstic experience, and I would be happy to go back again any chance I get.
