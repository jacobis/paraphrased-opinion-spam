My Stay with the Hotel Affinia was very comfortable!  My expectations were met, and then some! The Staff was hospitable, and the customer service exceptional!  I felt welcome and safe to walk to the close by attractions and food.  The room was clean, the snack bar full, and the bed comfy and inviting -- not to mention the selection of pillows for everyone's preferences to be met!  The walk in shower made me want one in my own home!  I would love to stay again and explore even more of Chicago! Thank you Hotel Affinia, I had a wonderful time!
