This hotel was absolutely stunning!  At first I was apprehensive because the price seemed really modest at best and thus, my first thought was. "Okay, what corners are they cutting here?"  However, after receiving nothing but the utmost customer service and having staff that seemed to bend over backwards to meet my needs I knew that I had chosen the right place.  I was not disappointed when I saw my room either; very well kept, clean, and more importantly - spacious to allow me to move around freely.  In addition, this hotel sits on a great location so you have complete access to some of the most memorable sights and sounds in the city.  Would highly recommend!
