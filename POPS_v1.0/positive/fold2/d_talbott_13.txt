My wife and I stayed at the Talbott Hotel on our recent trip to Chicago, and we both thoroughly enjoyed the experience. From the moment we arrived to the morning we left, the service was consistently top-notch. Everyone on the staff was helpful and friendly, and it really helped make our stay special. The hotel itself is decorated beautifully, in an elegant and subtle way. The attention to detail really shows that this isn't a big corporate hotel, and that makes a lot of difference. The rooms themselves are spacious and light, and the beds are incredibly comfortable. The hotel restaurant makes a great breakfast, and when we wanted to dine out, the concierge helped us get dinner reservations, even recommending which of the many nearby restaurants were best. We didn't get to stay very long, but it was great to have the Art Institute and Theater District within walking distance in the time we had to explore. We didn't have to call a taxi even once until we had to head back to the airport! We'll definitely be back the next time we're in Chicago.
