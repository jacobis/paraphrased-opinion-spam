The location of this hotel was one of the best things about it. It is right where everything is that you would want to go to and has a beautiful view all around it. The food is also great and had me coming back for more. I would go for each meal and each time it was delicious and the staff was wonderful for everything. There are many sights and touristy things to do around the hotel and its all within walking distance. From stores to plays and taking the train to get to places, you can get almost anywhere you would want fairly quickly. The bathroom is beautiful with marble flooring and even has a hair dryer right there for easy access to dry your hair right out of the shower. No matter what size room you get they are always spacious and clean and sometimes you are even upgraded to a better/bigger room. The beds are tremendously comfortable. All in all, this is a great hotel and I recommend this to anyone and can't wait for my next stay.
