This hotel is in a great, safe, location with 5 star customer service. What more could you ask for? There's a wonderful restaurant inside, but, surprisingly, breakfast is included with the room rate! The room is large and very comfortable. It's a tiny noisy, but most hotels are these days. So no complaints really. The bathroom is lovely, the whole experience was amazing.
