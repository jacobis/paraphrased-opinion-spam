The Talbott has left a good impression, and it's not too easy to do so after the countless amount of hotels I have been to. This downtown Chicago boutique hotel is in a great location and is very well maintained. The room I stayed in was big enough for a family of 4, with enough space to move around comfortably. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful, there were only a few times that I noticed construction happening nearby but the noise is not loud enough to interrupt you or catch your attention. I really enjoyed the way the staff treated my family and seemed to be truly and genuinely concerned about our comfort and experience. I would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to my friends traveling to Chicago.
