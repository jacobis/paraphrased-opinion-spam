Our stay at the Talbott was delightful, everything from the service to the location was amazing. The concierge and rest of the staff were very cheerful and upbeat, making you feel warmly at home. The bathroom had the perfect sized tub and the shower was just right. The hotel offers great amenities such as free wifi, gym access, a breakfast cafe, and even a music mp3 player, ect. The location was quiet and tucked away although right in Downtown Chicago, simply a hidden gem. And at last but not least the room was spacious and comfy, never did i even feel as if i was in a hotel. Much better that the surrounding hotels.
