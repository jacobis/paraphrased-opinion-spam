The Ambassador East Hotel is a beautiful hotel in a nice area of Chicago. Conveniently located near the magnificent mile it has many amenities nearby.  It is close to shopping and many restaurants. The Pump Room nearby has been a place that we enjoyed.  I have hear that they offer several different packages to accommodate different occasions.  The rooms seem large and spacious, and bathrooms clean.  The linens were nice.  Overall the staff was kind and generous, and it was a wonderful stay.
