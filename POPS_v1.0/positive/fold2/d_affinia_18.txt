I absolutely loved my stay at the Affinia. The hotel was recently remodeled and is quite beautiful. The rooms are great too! I had a large two bedroom suite with a fabulous bathroom. It was very clean and comfortable! They even had a menu to choose the type of pillow you want! The service was outstanding. Everyone there was so friendly and helpful! I also loved the fact that there were so many great restaurants close by...some even within walking distance! I definately recommend this hotel!
