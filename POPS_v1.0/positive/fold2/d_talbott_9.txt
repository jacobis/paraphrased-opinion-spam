Beautiful just beautiful hotel! I was amazed at how peaceful everything was especially have construction right across the street from the hotel. With it being downtown you would think everything would be so pricey, but it was a very reasonable price. The bedroom was nice and huge in my room it was just me and 1 other person but if it was a family vacation having additional people in the room would have been okay as well. The bathroom was nice a lot of hotels I been in they don't have a hair dryer, but this hotel had one and it wasn't a built in wall hair dryer neither. To top everything off was the service. The service matches with the hotel. Nice hotel awesome service. Whatever I needed front desks made it happen. Will stay again!
