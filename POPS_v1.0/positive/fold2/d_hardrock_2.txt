When we first arrived, the concierge unloaded our van and took it to our room, which we were extremely grateful for after a long trip.  The rooms were absolutely beautiful and spacious, which was surprising considering the amazing price we snagged.  Not being from Chicago, you could imagine how hectic it was for us to find our way around.  However, the hotel concierge easily pointed us in the right direction with a smile on his face. That is a hard service to find these days. Our days went from early morning to late at night with a whole lot of walking, so it was nice to be able to come back with a greeting from the service desk and a ridiculously comfortable and huge bed to stretch out on. The nice big bathroom was a nice touch and extremely clean. This made it easy for a family of 4 to share comfortably. I loved my experience with this hotel and the service was amazing!!!!!
