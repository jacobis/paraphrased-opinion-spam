My husband and I stayed at the Affina hotel for a romantic getaway weekend. We were so surprised when saw how well the room was set up. The decor was modern and there was ample space to move around. The beds were comfortable and reminded me of home. The best part of the hotel was the location. It was near Michigan Avenue so plenty of shopping and dining options. The staff was wonderful and willing to help at every turn. I will definitely stay at this hotel the next time I'm in Chicago.
