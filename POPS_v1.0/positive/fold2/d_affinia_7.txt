The Affinia was amazing! It was in a great spot in the city, with lots of attractions nearby! There was a movie theater and multiple restaurants nearby! The price for the hotel was very respectable for where it is, and what is around it. The room was great itself, with the little touches I wasn't expecting but loved! The bed was so soft and I slept like a baby. Highly recommended!
