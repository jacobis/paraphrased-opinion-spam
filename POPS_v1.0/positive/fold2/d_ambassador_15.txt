I had a great experience at the Ambassador East.  I stayed their when traveling with friends for a girls weekend away.  The staff was always very friendly and helpful.  The room was clean and charming.  We enjoyed the Pump Room for a couple of cocktails before heading out to town.  The location made it easy to walk to the shopping and nightlife. We had such a great time.  We can't wait to come back for our annual girls trip.  We look forward to visiting the Ambassador East again.
