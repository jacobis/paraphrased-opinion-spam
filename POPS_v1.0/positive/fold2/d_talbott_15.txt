I stayed at the Talbott in Chicago and it was really the right place to stay. It's a small hotel near Four Seasons. The location is very convenient, basically right in the middle of the city. I was able to walk from my hotel to the Magnificent Mile, the Gold Coast and Old Towne. They had the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. Their breakfast was delicious and hot. The service and concierge was impeccable always nice and ready to help with a smile on their face. Can't wait to stay at the Talbott again.
