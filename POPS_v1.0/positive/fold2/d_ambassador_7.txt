I think that Ambassador East is one of the "better" hotels in the area. The room was clean and cozy, it kind of reminded me of home. The prices are mediocre and cheap, a lot better than some other places that overcharge yet give poor customer service. The view and location is amazing, me and my family were not even that far away from the lake. The employees are friendly and nice, one even asked me if I needed any fresh linens or towels during the middle of my stay. A lot of the employees are helpful and will go that extra mile for the customer. Definitely coming back to this hotel during my next visit to Chicago.
