I stayed at the Hard Rock for 3 nights recently.  Wow, it was incredible.  The room was amazing, super comfortable bed and sheets.  The bathroom was impecable, stocked with Aveda toiletries, I was quite impressed with that.  The room was decorated as you would expect from the hard rock.  We got a great rate for the room and I will definitely be coming back.  The staff was so helpful each time I spoke with them.  They went out of their way to get us whatever we needed.
