We decided to go to Chicago for our honeymoon. We wanted to absorb all the city has to offer so we decided to stay in two different hotels. We made an excellent choice for the first stop. We got a great deal on a room at the Ambassador East Hotel. We only paid $89 a night. We told the front desk it was our honeymoon and we got upgraded to a suite! It was spacious and the room was very comfortable. We slept well because the bed was so comfortable. When we felt like walking, we only had to walk 10-15 minutes to the Miracle Mile. There were a lot of places to eat and shop that were only 2-3 minutes away from the Ambassador East. We were curious about the The Pump restaurant because of its historical meaning. Frank Sinantra used to eat there. We ate in the Frank Sinantra booth that had curtains around it. It was nice but the service and the food was not that spectacular. It was a little disappointing because the hotel has excellent service. When we went to the Pump room on the weekend, it was much more lively and we had a great time just getting a cocktail before dinner. We walked along historical streets with big mansions. Overall, our stay at the Ambassador East was wonderful. We would highly recommend this place to anyone for their honeymoon.
