The Hard Rock hotel is a great place to stay anytime of the year. With their extremely friendly staff and many amenities it is hard to find anything not to like about the hotel. The different themed floors was a great surprise and really cool to see. Being a Beatles fan I particularly enjoyed getting to stay on the 5th floor. Our room supplied us with everything that we needed, a comfy bed, internet access, and a pretty good size television. They also have a pretty good gym to use that is open 24/7 and it was really clean when I stopped in. This is a great place to stay especially for families and there are plenty of touristy things to do around the hotel.
