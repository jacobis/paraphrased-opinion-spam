We stayed at the Ambassador Hotel East. The location was great, it was tucked away in a neighborhood which made us feel safe.  The staff was very competent, friendly and more than attentive to our needs. Breakfast was nothing fancy but enjoying the history of the hotel made the breakfast more than worthwhile. The staff is top knotch and greets you with eye contact, which made us feel very important and welcome. Housekeeping is excellent and prompt. We would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Gold Coast area of Chicago. Five stars all around!
