The Ambassador East in Chicago is a great place to stay. The hotel is located within a short distance of many local sights and landmarks. Classically styled and elegant, the lobby welcomes you as you seek a place to unwind and rest. The comfortable rooms are very affordable. The food at the hotel is great, but there are also many restaurants nearby to explore.
