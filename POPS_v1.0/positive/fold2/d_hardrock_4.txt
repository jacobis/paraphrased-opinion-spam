I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  The rooms were spacious and very comfortable.  The bedding was like sleeping on a cloud!  There were a lot of premium channels on the TV that were included in the price of the room - no more pay-per-view!  Service was fantastic - the bellhop was very courteous and was fun to talk to, front desk people were extremely helpful.  The location was also great; just minutes away from several sights and shopping areas.  And to think that all this came at such a low price!  I'd definitely stay here again.
