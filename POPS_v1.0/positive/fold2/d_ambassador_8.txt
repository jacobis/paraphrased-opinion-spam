I have to say that I am very impressed with the Ambassador Hotel. First of all, this is a very good rate considering the location in Chicago and booking during the busy summer months. I got the room for under $200 which is great given that it's very close to the waterfront. The doorman promptly took my bags as I walked in and the front desk was very helpful and friendly during the check-in process. They even arranged for the refrigerator that I requested to be sent up to the room. When I got to my room and opened the door I immediately noticed how clean the place looked and smelled. The linens were fresh and the bathroom was spotless. And the view was absolutely fantastic! I couldn't believe how much of the city you could see! Since the hotel is historic it has a very cool vibe to it. You can definitely feel it in the way the interior is decorated. It's very clean, classy and posh. I would definitely stay here again. The staff was incredibly polite and treated my like I was a regular customer. I'm very glad I chose the Ambassador and look forward to staying there again!
