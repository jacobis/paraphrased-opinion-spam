We had a wonderful stay here. The staff was very friendly and the room was spacious and fully stocked, even a toothbrush and toothpaste. The soft lighting and combinations of grays and whites made for a soothing experience, and the bed was extremely comfortable. There is a very nice gym, a breakfast buffet, and a delicious restaurant called China Grill. Though the hotel is fabulous, we spent most of our time out in the city seeing the sights. The hotel is only minutes walk away from almost everything we wanted to see, and near the Metra for travel to and from the airport. There are a couple of great places to grab breakfast nearby for those like us who want to get out and start exploring, rather than utilize the hotel breakfast. All in all, we would definitely stay in a Hardrock again!
