My husband and me decided to stay at this hotel for a long weekend to renovate strength after a very long year and we loved it. The maids, concierge and really the whole staff was very nice and respectful and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The bedroom was simply gorgeous, very clean and well maintained. The location of the hotel was very accessible and the surrounding areas were beautiful and in a very quiet neighborhood. We ate a few times at there restaurant and the food was to die for. All in all we would definitely go back next year!!
