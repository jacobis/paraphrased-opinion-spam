The Hard Rock Hotel is an excellent place to stay. The building is beautiful, trendy and stylish inside and out. The service was excellent and the rooms were a good size, clean and bed comfy. Location is awesome,very close to Lake Michigan, Millennium Park, and Art Museum. Definitely better than the other chain hotels, would stay here again for sure!
