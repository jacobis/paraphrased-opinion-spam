I was exhausted after a long drive, so it was wonderful to have the bellhop immediately available to take my luggage up to the room. The staff were friendly and welcoming.  I had a spectacular view of the lake from my room. It was dark when i arrived and seeing the lights of the city reflecting on the lake inspired me to get out and do something even though I was tired. I didn't have to go far either--everything I could want was nearby. Restaurants, shopping, and entertainment were all within walking distance. The room was like a luxurious studio with a small kitchenette and sitting room in addition to the bedroom and bathroom.  It was extremely clean and comfortable.   I feel like I got an excellent value for the price I paid.
