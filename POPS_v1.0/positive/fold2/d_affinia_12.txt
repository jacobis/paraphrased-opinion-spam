Based on what I've read about the hotel this seems like a really great choice for a hotel. I really enjoy hotels with big rooms and from reading the size of these rooms couldn't be better plus I'm used to those really industrial looking hotels and I'd like to experience something more homey. Also I love when a staff goes above and beyond, a lot of hotels have a really hands off approach and I don't like that to much. All in all a hotel is like a mini home away from home where you may not be there very often but you want it really nice when you come back. The only real issue I may have is wifi but I'm sure I'll be able to manage.
