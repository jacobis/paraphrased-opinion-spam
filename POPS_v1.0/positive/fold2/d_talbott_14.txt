The Talbott is great little boutique hotel just minutes away from the heart of the Mag Mile. This hidden gem was everything that we needed for our weekend getaway to the Windy City. The service was top notch. The food options at the hotel were great, and there are countless restaurants in the surrounding area as well. The room and overall design of the hotel was very impressive. I can't wait to stay at this hotel the next time I visit Chicago.
