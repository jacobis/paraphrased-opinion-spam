We stayed 6 amazing days in the Affina hotel. All the staff here were very friendly and the rooms were very clean and spacious. This hotel doesn't feel like your typical chain hotel, it feels more like a boutique hotel, the location is right next to a Neiman Marcus and a 2 minute walk from the John Hancock tower. The hotel has a cute little pub in the basement that has good sandwiches and beer. There is free breakfast every morning so take advantage of that! Some downsides are the parking isn't free and the wifi costs $9.99. A few minor things that definitely won't get in the way of me wanting to stay here again. This hotel was amazing.
