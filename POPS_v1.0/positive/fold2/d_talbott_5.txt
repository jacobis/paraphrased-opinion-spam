The Talbott is a wonderful hotel! Great shops, restaurants, and nightlife are all within easy walking distance. If you can get this hotel for around $250 a night it is an amazing deal. It is a smaller hotel but extremely romantic and luxurious. There is no gym in the hotel but there is a gym right next door and they let me use the facilities for free! I would love to stay at this hotel again. My only concern however is that there are new condos being put up near the hotel and the construction might get a little annoying!
