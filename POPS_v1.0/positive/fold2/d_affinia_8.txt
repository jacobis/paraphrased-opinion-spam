My stay at the Affinia was a wonderful experience! The staff were professional, the rooms were spacious and lavish, and the location was close to a lot of attractions and dining. I would recommend the Affinia to anyone! They have a huge IMAX theatre which I enjoyed. The hotel was undergoing renovations when I was there so I expect that when finished, this hotel will be even better!
