Upon arriving at this hotel, I was amazed at the polite and courteous staff. We were treated like royalty. Our room was lovely and relaxing, with plenty of room to spread out. The hotel was perfectly located downtown so that we could easily get to all the events we had planned. This convenience cannot be more appreciated. Even better, on those occasions when we need downtime the room service and food was just wonderful. We will definitely be returning here.
