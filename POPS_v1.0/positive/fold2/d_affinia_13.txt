Hotel is luxurious with great service and friendly, accommodating staff. Decor is fun and everything feels fresh and new throughout. The views from the rooms on higher floors are amazing with a wall of windows. Location is superb being close to the beach, shopping and restaurants and with easy access to local transport.
