I didn't have much hope for this new hotel, as I hadn't had much in the past, but after staying here a couple days, I love it! The service was great; the concierge was polite, helpful, and extremely warm. You needed something he had it. Information? Check. More Towels? He sent someone in a couple minutes. Reservations for a restaurant? No problem. He'd handle that too. And the rooms! The bedding was absolutely gorgeous, the room was spacious and again, beautiful. Also, the view of the hotel is great. They have a rooftop bar with heaters, and comfortable couches. Basically, everything about this hotel was perfect and I would use this hotel again in a heartbeat. Price was great for what you get too.
