This was an awesome hotel to stay at.  First off, the room.  Incredibly clean, good TV with a sound system, excellent mini-bar.  Everything about the room was incredible, including the view!  If you stay here, try and get one with a view down Michigan Ave and you will not be disappointed.  Another tip, if you like to "acquire" the free shampoo bottles and goodies, tip your maid and it'll be like another Christmas!  Outside of the room is, of course, Rock & Roll theme everywhere (including the music obviously).  However, the bar area was actually a bit of a surprise.  It was a very casual area, with not as much of the "in your face" Rock & Roll theme as everywhere else.  This is a pleasant contrast to the rest of the hotel if you want some place to socialize and relax a bit.
