This is the place to stay in Chicago.  The decor is out of this world.  I love all of the music memorbilia and you feel like you are walking down memory lane.  You are able to choose which band you prefer and stay on that floor.  The location is great.  I am still in love with the comfort of the bedding and the layout of the room.  The staff is top of the line.  I think I may have forgotten to mention that the toiletries included are second to none and the rooms are absolutely the cleanest i have ever found.  Some hotels just look clean but this one is actually so very clean.  You can't go wring staying here if you plan on staying in the loop in Chicago.
