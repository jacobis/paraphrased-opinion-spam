The Talbot is a lovely hotel in a great location, very close to shopping and the major destinations. While the hotel is small and there is some construction outside, without a good view from the window, but the location cannot be beat. Along with that, the rooms are very spacious and comfortable, even though the hotel is small. The bathroom is very nice, and the beds are extremely comfortable. The doorman is also very helpful in arranging transportation and giving advice on good places to go to have a good time. I very much recommend this hotel for a stay, and my girlfriend loved it as well.
