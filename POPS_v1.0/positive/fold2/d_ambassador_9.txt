In my mind, the Ambassador East is a picturesque get away for a weekend. The rates are a tad pricey, but you do get what you paid for. You'll be surprised by the excellent service here as people are always greeting you and asking how you are. The hotel is located a little out of the middle of things, but it is easy to get around. Public transportation is available and easy to find. The only downside is that the furniture may be a bit outdated, but it gives the hotel a classic feel that makes you feel at home away from home. Would overall recommend!
