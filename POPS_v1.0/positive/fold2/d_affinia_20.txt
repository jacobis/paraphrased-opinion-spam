The Affina hotel in Chicago is a hotel that I would highly recommend. The location is perfect for sightseeing and other tourist attractions because it is within walking distance of many locales that ensure a true Chicago experience. The service I received was impeccable. All concierge and staff members were very professional and attentive, and they helped make my stay the best that it could be. The room, itself, was spacious and welcoming. The bedding was divine and the pillow selection allowed me to sleep well every night. The bathroom amenities were high quality and pristine. I would definitely stay here again!
