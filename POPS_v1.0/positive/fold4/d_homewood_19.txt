It has been a while since I had stayed at Homewood Suites, but I need to say that I was pleasantly surprised that the level of quality that I had previously experienced has not diminished at all, and I would even dare say that it has actually gotten better. Even though the hotel seems fairly busy at all times the staff there goes out of their way to make one feel welcomed at all times. All the employees seem genuinely happy to be working there.   The room was very clean and well appointed with 2 large flat screen TVs, a very large bed, a separate lounge area, and a mini-kitchen. You can't beat the location either, it is only a short walk to the subway, and you can easily walk to a wide variety of restaurants and shops. I will definitely be staying here on any future trips to Chicago.
