The next time your in Chicago a hotel you must see is Homewood Suites. The hotel is in a nice location with all amenities close by. Plenty of shops and many places to eat near by. The customer service at the hotel was excellent. The room was large with a pull out couch, kitchen, two flat screen tv's.  They served a wonderful breakfast and supper at that. Completely felt at home. There was also business center, pool, and gym that you could use as well. Definitely will be reserving there again if i'm ever back in Chicago again.
