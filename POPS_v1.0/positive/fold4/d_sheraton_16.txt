This hotel absolutely surpassed my expectations because I was used to hearing negative things about the Sheraton/Starwood. However, I was treated like a king. The staff was pleasant, and the room was comfortable. The hotel is located next to the Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous Fox & Obel and a high end grocery store. My kids enjoyed the pool with the pool's windows overlooking the Chicago river. The staff made us feel very special while we were there. They left cookies for our children upon check-in. You could tell the employees loved their job because everyone was so happy to be there working for the customers. The breakfast buffet was delicious. They have an omelet bar where you can have your eggs cooked just how you like them. Young children get to eat for free and older children have a reduced bill. The staff was there to help us when we arrived; they assisted my family with unloading the taxi and getting us checked in. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. There is plenty to do in the area surrounding the Sheraton. My family walked, trolled, a cabbed around the area to catch all of the sites. We noticed that our rooms were upgraded to club level; we stayed in 3114 and 3115. The maids on 29th floor were very friendly and efficient when it came to cleaning our room. This was another great experience, and I will be sure to come back again.
