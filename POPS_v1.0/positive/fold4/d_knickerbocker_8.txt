the location and the renovation of the guest hotel were beyond my expectations. The beds, service met if not exceeded what i had hoped for on this trip to chicago, they know your name, attend to you in the mornings, and has everything you ever asked for or more provided in your hotel room! With shopping on the way i can get everything i need to be done without any hesitation. this is a one of a kind hotel i would recommend to any one i know.
