Some reviews really knock this hotel--but from what I'm led to understand, I can't see why. The building itself is a beautiful old historic edifice. We checked in easily; the staff were very helpful and did their best to see us to our room with a minimum of difficulty. The rooms are not large, I have to say. They wouldn't be ideal for entertaining or large families, but that said, the rooms are clean and tidy. The beds are magnificent, and we slept well on our plush double. The showers are also a high point, with great temperature control and deluxe fittings. The only low point here was the difficulty we had in getting a trolley. We ended up having to take a taxi instead, only to learn later on that the trolley does travel to our intended destination. But other than this perplexing incident, our stay was wonderful. I would recommend this hotel to most people.
