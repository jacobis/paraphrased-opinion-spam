I stayed in this hotel for a weekend trip to Chicago. The location is fabulous! So near the Magnificent Mile and plenty of restaurants and markets close by to stop in to pick up essentials. The view from my room was beautiful beautiful and I really liked the ability to prepare and store some food in the little kitchen.
