Took a trip to Chicago and booked a room at the Swissotel without knowing much about it. Didn't expect much. Boy were my expectations blown away! We were put in a corner room on the 28th floor, and the view was stunning. You can see the city, river, and lake Michigan extremely well. Probably one of the best views in the area. The room was spacious and the bathroom was one of the best I've ever had. Staff was very nice too, and it was a great rate. I liked the modern lobby and sitting areas for when we wanted to socialize. Will definitely stay here again when I come back to Chicago!
