I enjoyed staying at the Knickerbocker very much. Not knowing anything about Chicago, I booked the Knickerbocker blindly, based on its good rate and location. I was pleasantly surprised; the hotel is clean, very well staffed, and quite beautiful. Everyone treated me with the upmost respect, from the bellhops to the concierge. The room was cozy, but perfect for a traveller like me. The bathrooms were immaculate too. While I didn't get to spend too much time roaming around Chicago, I was very happy to stay at the Knickerbocker for the duration of my trip.
