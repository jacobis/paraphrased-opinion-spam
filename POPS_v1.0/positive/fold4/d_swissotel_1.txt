The Swissotel in Chicago is a fantastic value for the price.  For not much more than a budget motel, you can enjoy the spacious rooms and top-tier service that the Swissotel has to offer.  The rooms are wonderful and spacious, and the facilities are immaculately clean.  perhaps best of all, there is not a bad view in the building.  You will have a fantastic view of the river, the lake, and some of the most sight-worthy parts of Chicago from the Swisshotel (and if you can get a corner room on one of the top floors, it will be breathtaking).  I would guarantee this hotel to anybody visiting Chicago.
