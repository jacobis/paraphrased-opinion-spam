My stay at the Knickerbocker Hotel could not have been better. The hotel itself was beautiful but what truly made my stay great was the staff. They truly went out of their way to make sure my family and I were comfortable and satisfied with our stay and that we enjoyed our time visiting Chicago. Yes the room was a little on the small side like others have said but the rooms interior is truly gorgeous with a historic feel yet supplies all the comforts of home and our modern society. I truly enjoyed my stay and look forward to staying with you all again.
