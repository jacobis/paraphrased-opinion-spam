Comfortable, clean, and spacious rooms at an affordable rate!  At such a great price,  I was pleasantly surprised with both the complimentary breakfast and dinner.  The staff members were extremely helpful and friendly,  going the extra mile to make our stay memorable. I could not pick a better location,  being minutes from shopping and restaurants.   I would definitely stay here again in the future!
