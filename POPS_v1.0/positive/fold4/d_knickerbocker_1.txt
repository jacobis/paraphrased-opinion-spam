My wife and I were in town for an event at the Drake Hotel, but opted to stay in the Knickerbocker Hotel across the street for a more comfortable experience, and for half the price! Although the rooms were slightly smaller (comfortably fitting a couple, perhaps not family sized) we thoroughly enjoyed the Asian decorating aspects mixed with the modern flat screen TV. Enough can't be said about the bathroom. There was no tub, however there was an incredibly elegant shower with waterfall shower head and wand style attachment. You could tell of the recent renovations to the property, I have been there several times during my college days and it has improved dramatically. The location couldn't have been better. We were within blocks of all the shopping and eating options Chicago has to offer, without having to pay twice as much. We were happily able to walk to most of our destinations, which is good to note because of the rather high price on parking at nearly $50 per night. I would suggest maybe leaving your car in a garage outside of town for a weekend trip and using taxi's or the metro to get into and around the city during your time there, it will be much cheaper. The service at the Knickerbocker was bar none. Immediately after pulling up, your bags are unloaded from the car and trained into the lobby while a generous doorman greets you and welcomes you into the establishment. I would highly recommend anyone to stay here while visiting Chicago. With all the exciting things to do in the city, you wont be spending much time in your room. But you would have wished you were there to enjoy it more often, trust me.
