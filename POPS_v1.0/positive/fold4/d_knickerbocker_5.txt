The Knickerbocker in Chicago is a great place to stay. It's a historical hotel that has recently been renovated with all new, more modern accommodations. The bathrooms have great showers in them and the staff is friendly. The in hotel restaurant has great food and the drinks at the bar are top shelf.  The hotel itself is located close to several great places to visit including the Cheesecake Factory, Bloomingdales, the Einstein Bagel Company, Macys and Saks. All in all it's a great place to stay anytime you are in Chicago.
