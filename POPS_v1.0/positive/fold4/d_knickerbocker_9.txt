This hotel is great, and we got a great deal through Priceline!  The room was modern and well-furnished.  (So you get the best of both worlds, with a modern room in a beautiful historic building.)  The room was on the smaller side, but that's fine for us-- we came to see the city, not to see a hotel room.  Our bathroom had an amazing shower.  We were close to public transportation and lots of great sites.  In the evening, we had some very nice cocktails at the bar before bed.  Overall it was everything we expected: a clean hotel with all the amenities we needed, providing a perfect home base during our stay.
