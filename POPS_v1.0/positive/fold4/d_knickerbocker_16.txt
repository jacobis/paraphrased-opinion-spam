Not only was this hotel a one of a kind place to stay, but the staff went above and beyond to provide exceptional service that makes you feel welcome and comfortable. The hotel bar is also very nice, it's classy and a place that makes you feel at ease. The rooms are priced competitively for the area and are great if you are looking for a unique place to stay while in Chicago.
