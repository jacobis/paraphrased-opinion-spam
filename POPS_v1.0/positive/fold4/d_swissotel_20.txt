This hotel has everything anyone could want. The service and staff are attentive, polite, incredibly helpful and truly go above and beyond. The rooms are spacious and well equipped and the bathrooms are luxurious.  On-site dining is excellent perk. However, the best part of this hotel is the view. Be it from the bedroom, bathroom, patio, or pool, the view of the Great Lakes and the Chicago skyline are second to none. Dollar for dollar, this hotel is hard to beat.
