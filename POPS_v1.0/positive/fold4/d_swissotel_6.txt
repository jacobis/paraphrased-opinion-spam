The Swissotel is a top notch great place to stay. The amenities and incentives of this hotel are amazing. Everything from the view of the Magnificent Mile and the Navy Pier where you can see the fireworks. In the heart of the city and within walking distance of many of the sights the city has to offer. They also do the little things like leaving a bottle of water in my car as I am leaving. With a high class hotel with the treatment of "feeling like home" it made for a great stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to the Chicago area.
