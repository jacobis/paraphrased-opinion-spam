Homewood Suites is a great place to stay if you are visiting Chicago. It is in an amazing location, mere steps away from food, fun, and shopping, some of which you will be able to see as part of the fantastic view from your room. You might not even feel the need to leave the hotel, the spacious rooms have a kitchen that allows for late night preparation, and with the more than accommodating staff providing breakfast and dinner every day you should be well fed and well rested. If you do decide to take on the city, you can rest assured that the room will be clean when you get back so you can once again take in the view, and fall asleep feeling comfortable and secure in the glow of good old Chicago, tucked in your comfy Homewood Suites bed.
