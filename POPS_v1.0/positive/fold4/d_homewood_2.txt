The Homewood Hotel in Downtown Chicago was just what I was looking for. It's a nice, clean hotel with a swimming pool for the kids. It's got great breakfast and dinner that is also included with the pre paid rate of $129. I think the price I paid was great value for what I was getting. The location is great, it's right next to the John Hancock building and within walking distance of a lot of other nice places for shopping, eating, and entertainment. The hotel staff are caring and considerate, they check on you and ask if you need anything. Also, all of the rooms in the hotel are suites. They can be 1 or 2 bedroom suites depending on what you choose which is cool. From the room you have a lovely view of Lake Michigan. Overall my stay at this hotel was splendid. everything just clicked together. The staff, the location, the view, the price, the foods, all of it.
