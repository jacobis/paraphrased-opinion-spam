The first thing I noticed when I arrived at the hotel was how great of a location it was in. Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue were within walking distance, and had great views of the Chicago River! The rooms were good sized, even if the ceiling was a little low. The beds were also super comfortable! And the service was great - very friendly and helpful staff who did everything they could to accommodate us. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area.
