The Swissotel Chicago is a great hotel. The service was great, the room was large, very handsome to look at and well equipped with seating and a desk to work at. The views were outstanding of both the river and lake, so try to get an upper level room. Public transportation stops directly in-front of the hotel, so no need for a cab. I would stay here again.
