Staying at Homewood while visiting Chicago was definitely a great experience. The hotel was right near a lot of the hot tourist spots, so it was very easy to walk to them. Parking at the hotel is expensive however, and you would do best to find somewhere else to park during the day. The rooms, although small, were quite and prepared well, and guests even get free dinner and breakfast. The hotel staff was all very friendly and kind. I highly recommend this place for families and business travelers who are passing through this unique city.
