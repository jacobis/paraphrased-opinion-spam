I had to go to Chicago for an interview recently. I stayed at this hotel for 3 days. Let me just say that even though I booked it so late the pricing was excellent and half the cost of the hotel across the street. More than that the service was excellent I had barely waited 5 minutes before I had my keys and was in my room. The staff were all friendly and they all were very helpful. The amenities of the room such as the Flat screen T.V. and decorations were really unexpected for the price. The condition of the room was excellent and clean. The bathroom while a bit small was really clean and great to use. Overall I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely recommend it to others.
