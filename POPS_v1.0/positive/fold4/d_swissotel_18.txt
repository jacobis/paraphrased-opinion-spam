My husband and I went for a weekend trip to Chicago and decided to stay here.  We made a great choice!  The staff was very friendly, helpful and courteous from the moment we checked in until the moment we left.  Our rooms were very spacious and inviting.  Everything was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable.  They had large windows and a great bathroom.  The hotel was unique and had unbelievable views of the city and of Lake Michigan!  It was breathtaking!  We had to order room service so we could enjoy the view and even the staff that delivered the food was wonderful!  Many of the sites we wanted to visit were within a short distance from the hotel.  The location could not have been any better.  It saved us a lot of money on transit charges.  The night before we left we ate in their restaurant and the food was outstanding and the staff was knowledgeable.  Next time we visit Chicago we will stay here again, hands down!
