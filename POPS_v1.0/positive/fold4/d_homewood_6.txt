This was a pretty great hotel, one that I would recommend to anyone looking to stay in this area. The room was plenty large for me and my wife, with a comfortable bed, nice bathroom, and a small kitchen for light cooking if needed. The free meals in the lobby well good enough as long as you don't go when everyone else is there. The hotel is located close to a lot of cool places to go, within walking distance, so it allows for a good view from the room and convenient access to sights and some touristy stuff. Valet parking is pricey, but full day parking around the area isn't much better. Public transportation, such as the subway, and walking is good enough to get most places, but the staff is also very nice if you do make use of the valet. Again, I would recommend this spot.
