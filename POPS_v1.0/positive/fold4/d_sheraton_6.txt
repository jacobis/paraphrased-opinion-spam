If you're looking for a hotel that has great views of the lake, and is close to shopping, don't look anywhere else! The views and the location alone make it worth staying here. They're incredibly accommodating if you ask them to check in early or check out late - essentially you can lengthen your stay without paying any more. The rooms them selves are very nice and super clean, which is very important to me. Internet seems to work very well here. Checkin is generally quick and you may get lucky and get an upgrade to an even nicer room! Make sure when you checkin, you ask for a room with a view, you won't be disappointed. Love that its located right on the riverwalk!
