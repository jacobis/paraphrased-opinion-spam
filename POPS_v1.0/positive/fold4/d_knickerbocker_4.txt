My wife and I absolutely loved our getaway at the historic and charming, Millenium Hotel in Chicago.  We booked this trip for our anniversary and we could not have been more pleased with our stay.  The location is superb for having easy access to tons of retail shops, all of the "must see" sightseeing adventures, and of course the endless selection of magnificent nightclubs and restaurants. We were so impressed by the excellent service that we received at the Millenium.  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted at our cab by a very kind doorman, and our luggage was delivered promptly to our room.  I was thrilled to also find that we could stay here for a fraction of the cost of the other nearby hotels.  It's always great to have a little extra money in your pocket! After check-in, one of the things that most impressed us was the exceptional job that the Millenium hotel had done on their recent renovations.  The hotel guest register was full, and yet it was so quiet and relaxing.  We could hear no noises from the other guests rooms or anything that could have disturbed our stay. The guest rooms were spotless and so inviting.  I loved the relaxing modern Asian influence style that they used.  The flat screen television was awesome and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  The bathroom was so beautiful that it made me wish we could copy the design for our own home!  I was in love with the expansive shower size with the rain shower AND an additional hand held shower wand ... that was a real treat!  The toilet area even had a wall flushing option that was very cool.  My wife was delighted to find that the lighting in the bathroom was perfect for her, as she was applying her makeup and getting ready for our nights out on the town. If you are planning to visit Chicago, we would highly recommend visiting the Millenium Hotel.  We look forward to returning there very soon.
