The location of this hotel was ideal for our trip. It is walking distance from Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, and the Chicago River. It is in a great location for siteseeing. The food choices available in the hotel were a little pricey, but the quality was good and it was very convenient. Our room was clean and comfortable and the price was right! I definitely recommend this for future bookings.
