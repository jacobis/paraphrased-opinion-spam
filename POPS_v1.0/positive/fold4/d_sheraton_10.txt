I had some trouble on the first night of booking as my booking had been lost, however the concierge quickly stepped up and got me booked elsewhere for the one night. I returned to the hotel the next day having my other room and transportation paid for. While it was upsetting to have my booking lost, I did enjoy that the hotel was able to help without prompting. The hotel has great views up on the top floor, and we were located near a cafe to eat. While the views of the city and river are great, inside feels a little cramped with the low ceilings of the halls and rooms.  However the room itself had comfortable bedding and accommodations and the location and view can't be beat!
