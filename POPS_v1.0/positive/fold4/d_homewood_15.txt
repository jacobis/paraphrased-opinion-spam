I stayed at the Homewood suites with my husband and two year old daughter for a trip to visit family in Chicago and had a fantastic stay! The hotel staff were so helpful and even made up the pull out couch for my daughter. I loved the free, hot breakfast and the to-go cups for the coffee were especially nice. My daughter really enjoyed the dinner options for kids. The room was clean and had a mini kitchen, which was great for storing snacks or leftovers. Since we really didn't want to drive in Chicago, it was nice to be within walking distance of both the eL and the bus. Really saved the stress of driving in the 'big city'. There were even some fun places to shop near the hotel, which was nice for a break from visiting family. i would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the Chicago area!
