The Swissotel in Chicago is in a great location, whether you are traveling for business or pleasure. The staff is very accommodating and friendly - early check-in was easy, they provide extra towels upon request, and the bellhop is always quick to find a cab to make getting to the nearby sights a piece of cake. The rooms are large, clean and quiet, with beautiful views of the city and lake. Definitely recommend this hotel for any visitors to the city.
