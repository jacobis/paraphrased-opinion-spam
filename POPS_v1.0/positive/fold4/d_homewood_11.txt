Looking for a clean, comfortable and spacious room in Chicago with a delicious breakfast spread with continental standards (like bagels and cereal) AND hot food (like waffles, omelettes, & burritos)? I'd recommend Homewood Suites in Chicago. It's a great extended stay hotel in a terrific location, right by Michigan Avenue and within walking distance of so many major sights. Whether you need help booking a room, valet service for your car, concierge service or just want to see friendly faces at the door, the staff here is competent, knowledgeable and friendly.
