The Sheraton in Chicago is a wonderful hotel with amazing service. This hotel is the favorite of many, and for good reason. Staying there is always a treat, since the staff are so friendly and the rooms are so nice. The staff are always bustling to provide the best service, and will do whatever necessary to accommodate you. The rooms themselves are clean and of great size; they're perfectly comfortable for anyone. Even better, they offer amazing views of the city. It's situated in a great part of town that lets you get wherever you want, be it sightseeing or business. Lastly, the food is great; I'd especially recommend the breakfast buffet. It's only $10 and it gives you an amazing meal to start your day!
