The Swiss hotel was a great spot for tourists visiting Chicago, or for locals to get away.  The quality of the hotel, and the service was outstanding and helped make our stay here at the Swiss hotel that much more enjoyable.  It is also located in a great area of town. The location of the Swiss hotel being between the financial district and the magnifecent mile (navy pier) makes it the ideal spot for a hotel.  They have a good breakfeast and good clean friendly service to go along with this magnificent location.  Our bed was comfortable enough to hypernate in, and the pools and the hot tubs were in fantastic shape.  Another bonus was the quick elevators after a long exhausting day of site seeing you can get to your comfortable bed in a quick fashion. The Swiss hotel in short was a very enjoyable stop for us.  The little things the staff did like add water to our car for the return trip made it that much better.  I was very pleased and I would recommend everyone who visits chicago to stay at the Swiss hotel.
