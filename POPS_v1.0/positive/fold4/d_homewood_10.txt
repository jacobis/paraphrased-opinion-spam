This hotel is basically everything I would have asked for in a place to stay. It was in the center of everything, which made getting to all the places I wanted to go to a breeze. The breakfast was great, and not just "great for a hotel", but legitimately great. The room was very spacious, and the beds were so comfortable, it was like being on cloud nine. The best part was the staff, who were all ready and willing to help with anything I needed. Although the price is a bit high, this was definitely a "you get what you pay for" situation; it was a very luxurious experience. This is one hotel I'll be looking to stay at over and over again.
