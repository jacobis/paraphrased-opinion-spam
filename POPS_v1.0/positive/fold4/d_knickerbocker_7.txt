We had such a great stay at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago!  Honestly, we weren't sure what we would find after reading the online reviews - but we just couldn't resist the low price and location ($130 for a stay on Michigan Avenue)!  We shouldn't have worried - the hotel was great, and provided everything we could have asked for!  The rooms were nice, and the amenities like dining, parking, and internet were just fine.  However, what really made our stay was the staff - so friendly and helpful!  From learning our names to correctly minor issues to recommending great food and activities...they made our stay a great one.  We will definitely be back at the Knickerbocker soon!
