The knickerbocker is an incredible hotel and I had a wonderful experience there. First of all, the location was great; close to the lakeshore but also the city. This was very helpful in a city such as Chicago. But not only that, the building was very nice- sort of old and traditional but in a very nice, quaint way. The room itself was very nice as well- smoke-free, with nice bedding and common amenities. As traditional as the facade of the building was, the room and inside was modern, with Chinese-like cabinets. Last, but certainly not least was the price- I received a great deal on it. $70! For a 4 star hotel like this, it was totally worth it. Great hotel, especially for the price!
