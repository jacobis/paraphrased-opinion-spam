I recently stayed at this Homewood Suites as part of a 1 week business trip. I would say the best feature of this hotel is the location. Almost anything you'd want you can walk a few blocks to get. I also really appreciated the courteous staff and I was always greeted with a "Hello" or "Good morning". My room was the perfect size and the kitchenette was perfect for days where I didn't want to eat out even though the food provided was really delicious. I would stay here again the next time I'm Chicago, whether it's for business or for pleasure!
