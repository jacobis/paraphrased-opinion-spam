I travel a lot for work and I've stayed at many hotels over the years and I can honestly say that the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers is truly a wonderful hotel. Even though I'm traveling on business I always feel like I'm on a small vacation while at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers. From the helpful staff to the large rooms with the great views its to hard to find anything to complain about. The location of the hotel is also convenient so you can easily walk to nearby restaurants, museums, or whatever interests you. If you're a person who likes to say in there's also plenty do you. There's a pool, a gym, and enough great food to keep you full and happy. I highly recommend this wonderful hotel.
