This hotel has very clean bathrooms. It has a great location i was easily able to get to most parts of chicago in only a few minutes. The staff is really helpful. In the even that you do have a problem they will take care of it quickly and with little fuss. This is a great place to stay if you have to take care of business in chicago. Its proximity to Line 6 makes it really easy to get around without even having to call a taxi. The decor is very nice as well all of the fixtures in the hotel are sleek and attractive. The best part is the price if you find a special you can stay hear more cheaply than at some lesser quality hotels. I highly recommend this hotel.
