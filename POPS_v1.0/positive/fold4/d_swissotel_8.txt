I am from Illinois and visit Chicago twice a year and Swissotel is by far one of the best hotels Iv'e stayed at. It is more on the expensive end but so well worth it. The rooms are clean and spacious. The cozy bed is a welcome reprieve at the end of a long day. Lots of little extras such as loads of comfy pillows, a pool and hot tub and a view from the room that is priceless. It is a bit of a walk from Navy pier but transportation is readily available and there are many other activities and things to see that are conveniently located near the hotel. You will never be without something to do. Overall, this is a great place to stay. Customer service here is unbeatable, the people are just great, they even left water bottles for us to enjoy upon leaving. Trust me, you wont be disappointed.
