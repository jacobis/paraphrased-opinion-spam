The Swissotel is probably my favorite hotel in Chicago. Every time I've stayed the room has been impeccably clean and comfortable. The beds are so much softer than what I've come to expect from other hotels. The view of the city was beautiful from higher up and it was so easy to get around to all the different touristy areas. I recommend walking over to the Navy Pier or Millennium Park, since both are so close by. My wife and I will definitely stay here again next time we're in the area.
