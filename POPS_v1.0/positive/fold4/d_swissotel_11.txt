A friend of mine stayed at the hotel on a business trip a few weeks ago. He seemed very impressed. The rooms were clean and spacious, as well as the bathrooms. He also said the rooms were very quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the front desk met all of needs such as an earlier check in time. Even though he was there on business, my friend found the location to be great for shopping and dinning, as the hotel is right in the middle of town. He also told me that the gym had excellent views and was overall very nice. I will definitely stay at the Swissotel when I am in Chicago.
