Wow. We just heard about the Knickerbocker hotel and I cannot wait to stay.  Our friends said that it had the most amazing view of chicago and that it was truly breathtaking.  The service and staff were incredibly hospitable and friendly.  They truly made our friends feel at home.  The bathrooms, we heard, are luxurious and perfectly sized.  As for the rooms, they said they were updated and everything worked but clearly had the elegance and class of an older hotel.  As for location, it is right around the most interesting attractions Chicago has.  That is a huge plus for us when getting a hotel, as the taxi rides can really add up.  We are just so excited to stay at the Knickerbocker!!!
