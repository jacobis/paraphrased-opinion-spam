This hotel is a steal for a great price.  Several deals can be found on Priceline to snag a room for under 100$.  All the rooms are very spacious and clean.  This hotel has breathtaking views of the lakefront and is very close to Michigan Ave.  The hotel staff is very friendly and waiting to assist you with any needs you may have.  To top it off the luxurious pool is a great addition to all the amenities you already get with your stay.
