This Sheraton Hotel is fantastic!  The views of the Navy Pier and Lake Michigan are really breathtaking.  The restaurant had great food, and the staff of the hotel was really attentive and friendly.  It's in a great location, too, because you can walk right to the Magnificent Mile.  When I go to Chicago again, I'll definitely stay at this great Sheraton hotel!
