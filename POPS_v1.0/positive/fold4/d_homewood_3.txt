I used to travel to Hong Kong, Kowloon hotel, the hotel is look from the exterior, hotel design fashionable and convenient transportation, located in the heart of the city.
But the lobby manager's attitude is not good, and I set the room requirements must be two beds. 
Only to be told that no room, but when I went to is at two o 'clock in the afternoon, not many people checked in.
Finally gave me a room with a very small, only a bed, the room was at the end of the corridor.Facilities of the hotel was good,for,example gym, swimming pool,.
