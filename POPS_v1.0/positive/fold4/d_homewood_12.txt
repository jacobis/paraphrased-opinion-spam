This hotel seems great! The breakfast buffet looks great and I am impressed that they have a whole assortment of breakfast items, not just the usual "continental breakfast" fare. The service and location sounds wonderful, especially the proximity to other areas of the city.  The valet is very important to me as I usually carry a good deal of luggage and do not wish to have to carry it across a large parking lot. The room amenities are also important.  As someone who frequently travels for business, the amenities in an extended stay hotel are important, particularly when it comes to preparing my own food or reheating leftovers. The access to wi-fi is also handy as it will allow me to work from the privacy and comfort of my own room. The proximity to other locations is also helpful as it will help me save a load on transportation.
