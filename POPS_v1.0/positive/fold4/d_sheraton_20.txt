I love, love, love the Chicago Sheraton Towers. I ended up staying there, just by chance. My flights got re-routed, and I couldn't get to my end destination, and the airlines gave me a voucher to use for any hotel. Since, I had time to kill that evening, I decided to stay downtown -- and ended up at the Sheraton. First, it was the right choice for location. Its within walking distance of many local sights and nightlife. The concierge on duty was awesome. He recommended a nice dinner spot and a safe walking trail that we took through the city. The next morning, I had to catch my flight, but had time for their breakfast buffet - which was a really great deal for $10. So, I loaded up on breakfast for my long day of travel. I would definitely consider staying here again, on my way to Seoul.
