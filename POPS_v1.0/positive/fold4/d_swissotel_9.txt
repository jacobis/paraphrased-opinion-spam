The Swissotel hotel is a great Hotel. With a great location in the downtown Chicago area. The rooms were very spacious and clean. Another positive is that the rooms/hallways were very quiet, I could hear no noise as I was sleeping in my room. The staff at the hotel were very kind and professional. The front desk was efficient and helpful, while the bellmen were able to quickly call a cab upon request. Overall I would say that my stay at the Swissotel was a very enjoyable one. I would book another room here again!
