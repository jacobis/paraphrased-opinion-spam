We enjoyed our stay at Homewood Suites.   The room was clean and was actually a large suite with kitchen which was handy because we could save money by eating some meals in our room.  The breakfast buffet hit the spot every day!  One of the best features about the hotel is the very convenient location, near all the popular attractions and also close to the subway.  But the thing we liked most is the courteous and friendly staff, they are very welcoming and make you feel at home!
