The Sheraton is a great hotel. It his located in a great place with a great view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. It is only a short walk away from the Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile shopping area, which is excellent. The service was amazing and the staff were all friendly. Checking in was easy and the maid service was top-notch. One of the best features of the Sheraton is their beds. You will not want to get out of them!
