This is a no older but updated hotel in a great location in Chicago. It has a old school charming feel, but will all the modern amenities anyone could need.  The hotel staff, including the doorman, Charlie is amazing. Among the staff, the housekeeping staff is great and dose a fabulous job keeping the room clean  everyday.
