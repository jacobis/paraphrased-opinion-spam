We stayed at Swissotel after receiving an amazing price on a room there. We were very impressed by the size and cleanliness of the rooms. The staff was also very accommodating and polite, we never felt as if we were just a number but treated as a valued guest. The location of the hotel is great, from the pool and hot tub you can actually see an overview of the city and even Navy Pier. Speaking of views, ours was breathtaking. It was a whole expanse of Lake Michigan, a beautiful sight to wake up to in the morning. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and cannot wait to return again.
