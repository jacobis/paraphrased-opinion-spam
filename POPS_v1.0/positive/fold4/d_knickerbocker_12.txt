You can get rooms at this hotel at much lower rates than other places in Chicago. If you use an online trip-planning service, you can definitely get a room under $100. It is in a very walkable part of town, but great transportation to area sites as well! The rooms are a good size, especially for a building of its historic age. The shower is to die for, I could spend all morning in there! And then I could spend the rest of the day lounging on the comfy beds, but I'd rather spend my day out in the city and then come to sleep on the fantastic mattress.
