I stayed at the Sheraton for 2 nights while visiting family nearby.  I was unsure of what to expect after reading mixed reviews online, but let me tell you, I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  The staff was more than accommodating.  They were helpful with location services, restaurant recommendations, and even upgraded us to a room with a better view.  This new room was incredible.  I would have been happy without leaving the room while we were there.  The view allowed us to see picture perfect sunsets, and our room was so spacious and cozy.  But after we did decide to step out of our room, we found that the recommended hotel restaurant was fabulous!  Not only was the hotel close to our family, but it's location was perfect for walking around to little local shops. So convenient!  I will be staying here on our next visit for sure!
