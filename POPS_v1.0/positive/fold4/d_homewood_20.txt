My husband and I recently stayed at the Homewood Suites for our 5th anniversary.  We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this hotel.  The front desk clerk was exceptionally warm and accommodating when we requested a king sized bed room instead of the two queen sized bed room that we originally booked.  The room itself was very clean, nicely decorated and was a lot bigger than we imagined.  Best of all, it had a mini fridge and a microwave to store/cook any leftovers we might have brought back.  The hotel was nicely situated close to Michigan Street for when we wanted to eat out or go shopping.  My favorite part of our stay had to be the breakfast buffet.  The food was delicious and kept clean and stocked.
