This hotel is a diamond in the rough! It is located in the Best area in Chicago....just off of Michigan Avenue. It is such a beautiful hotel. It looks like a mini palace. The furnishings were beautiful! The beds were so comfortable...I slept like a baby every night. The rooms were the perfect size for us....I loved our room!  I was SO impressed with the price...$90 a night!!!! The staff was so professional and helpful and friendly....I can't wait to go back!
