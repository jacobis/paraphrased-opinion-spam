The Swissotel was a great experience from top to bottom. The staff there was kind, attentive, and always eager to help out. The room was in excellent condition and provided a wonderful view the nearby sights. The gym, which is situated near the top of the hotel, also provides a nice view of the surroundings. Parking at the Swissotel was rather expensive so opting for a nearby parking lot may save you a good deal of money. Another great part about staying at the Swissotel is how close it puts you to all the action. The hotel is right next to a ton of restaurants, bars, and shops so there is no shortage of things to keep you busy. All in all, I would absolutely recommend the Swissotel to travelers looking for a place to stay in Chicago.
