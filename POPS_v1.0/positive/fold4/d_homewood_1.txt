I visited Chicago for 2 nights and decided to stay at Homewood based on a friend's recommendation. I arrived a bit late at night and was starving. I was asking the front desk staff members if they know of any place around the area that serves decent food at that late hour. I was pleasantly surprised when the helpful desk staff said that dinner and breakfast was offered for free to all guests on weeknights. I usually don't care for hotel food but Homewood's food was awesome. Needless to say, I ate at the hotel again the following morning. Homewood is in downtown so it is surrounded by great shopping and restaurant attractions. Everything is within a 5-10 minute walk. I didn't stay at the hotel much as I was visiting Chicago for sightseeing, but they do have a pool and tv's.
