I stayed at the swissotel and it was great - great price, room size, location, services, and of course the view! The price was reasonable for Chicago and the location was not far from activities. Close to transportation. The room was comfortable and the hotel has good amenities, like a pool. The view is fantastic! Would recommend staying here.
