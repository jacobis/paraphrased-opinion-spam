My first visit to Chicago I chose to stay at the Knickerbocker, and if I ever return, I will choose this hotel (right in the heart of the city!) over any others in the area.  The decor and the furnishings were so exquisite and unique, from the second I stepped foot into the lobby to the time I left, I felt like I got a fantastic deal!  The price I paid for this hotel and the quality I got, how could I not stay there again?!  The employees at the hotel (all but one of them, at least) were so welcoming and helpful.  It was nice to feel so comfortable, and the fact that unlike most hotels, even the maids were pleasant! If I had a problem, they were there to fix it and when I had down time and wasn't sure what to do around the city, they were able to point me in the direction of ANYTHING I wanted and were also able to give me some great suggestions of local activities!  The second day I was there, my meeting got cut short and I ended up having the afternoon and evening off work. I went back to my room thinking I would just watch TV or something, but when the concierge informed me that the best shopping in the whole city was practically right outside the door, I couldn't resist!  This hotel exceeded all my expectations.; from the room itself down to the tiniest details (like their bed sheets, which were almost too good!) this hotel made me want to stay longer! 5 Stars, thanks again! I will be back! XD
