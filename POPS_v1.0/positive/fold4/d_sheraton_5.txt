This hotel was AWESOME!  The view of the lake and Navy Pier is unbelievable...you couldn't ask for more.  The price was very reasonable.  Rooms were very spacious and CLEAN.  I didn't feel the need to worry about bed bugs or gross germs.  I couldn't have been happier with the room.  The staff was also great, they would totally go out of their way to help you and make sure you were happy...super friendly!  I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone!
