The Sheraton Hotel has always been my go to place when I travel. I love that the cost doesn't break the bank and the way the staff interact with you and get to make your stay more comfortable. I booked my hotel through Priceline and I was a bit skeptical at first that I wouldn't get the same treatment because I was using a discount. They still treated me the way they always do if not better. I got to check in early and the room they gave me was spacious and beautiful. The bed was so comfortable it was as if I was laying on a cloud. I especially love that its very close to Navy Pier. I can't wait until my next trip and in returning to the spectacular Sheraton.
