The Homewood Suites in Chicago was a home away from home! The staff were incredibly nice and attentive - it almost felt like they were family. My boyfriend, daughter, and I stayed here and loved the size of the room (gave her and us space) and free breakfast before heading out for the day. I used to live in Chicago so feel very comfortable with both the train and bus offerings, so the location getting to the stations and stops was ideal.
