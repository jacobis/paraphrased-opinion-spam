Homewood Suites is definitely the place I would return to on my next trip to Chicago.  It has excellent service, from the friendly staff and doormen, to the delicious food available at the hotel.  The rooms are spacious and well supplied with a small kitchen and large flat screen TVs, among other amenities.  There is public transit available close by, otherwise there are many places to eat and shop within walking distance as well.  With affordable pricing, nice amenities, and friendly staff I'd recommend all who are planning a stay in Chicago to stay at Homewood Suites.  I can't wait till my next trip back!
