You can't ask for a better Chicago experience than the Sheraton - the hotel is in a great location and the staff is friendly and accommodating. It's close to the sights of the city, whether you're looking for a laid-back evening at the cinema or seeing all the touristy destinations. The hotel can accomodate guests on short notice, and offers first-class amenities. Every staff member goes above and beyond. Breathtaking views of the river just top off the experience - we wouldn't hesitate to go back anytime we're in Chicago!
