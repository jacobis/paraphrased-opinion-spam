The Sheraton hotel in Chicago, with great views, right on the Chicago River. This location puts them right in walking distance of many of the tourist attractions, head down state street or michigan st or walk a few minutes to the cinema down the street. Though, if you are looking to get out a little further- They have an incredible concierge staff who will spend a great amount of time making sure that you have a taxi or transit bus ready to pick you up right outside the door and take you out. After your trip about the city you come back to a good sized, clean room to relax in and take in the views. The next morning when you get up you can head right to the buffet where you can pay $10 to eat all that you would like, for as long as you'd like. All in all, a great location, great stay, above and beyond staff, and if you use you AMEX you get Starwood points. Definitely worth a trip back.
