This hotel welcomed me with open arms; from the Welcome by the check in staff whom reassured what type of room I requested, to the quaint pool, awaiting my morning swims before I begin my day from this central location. The onsite restaurant was out of this world! A perfect end of day before I began my night in the amazing bedding the hotel provided! Would highly recommend this hotel.
