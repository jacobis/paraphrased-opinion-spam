I had a great time at the Fairmont when I stayed there during my trip to Chicago. I was a bit wary of the location as it is south of the river, but to my extreme delight I found I preferred it much more than my usual location north of the river! First off, the rooms are absolutely incredible, they are recently updated and exceedingly comfortable. If that wasn't enough my room had a great view of Monroe St. Harbor, this really gave it that extra touch. Speaking of extra touches, the staff at the Fairmont went out of their way to provide extra service, even to the extent of providing us with special cards that got us into the exclusive hotel restaurant without reservations. Although the food around Chicago is plentiful and delicious, this restaurant's food was top notch, we went twice and loved it both times. Finally I wanted to touch on the location of the Hotel once again; it is very close to Millennium park and all the attractions it holds. A simple walk brought you to the doorstep of the park. All in all it was a great experience and I would certainly recommend the Fairmont to anyone who is looking for a room near downtown Chicago!
