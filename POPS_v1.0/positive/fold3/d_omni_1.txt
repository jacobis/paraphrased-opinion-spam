We found a great place to stay in the heart of Chicago. Location is everything at the Omni and it is an easy and enjoyable walk to fabulous shopping on the Magnificent Mile. Tons of great restaurants within walking distance and the Loop and several cultural attractions are a short cab ride away. The concierge staff is incredible and will take care of your every need. A very comfortable bed, spacious suite and marble bath make this a luxurious place to stay. Coffee in the morning and cookies on your pillows make this Chicago location a really special getaway spot for business or pleasure. We highly recommend it.
