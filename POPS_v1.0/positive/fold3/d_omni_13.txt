The Hotel Omni is a beautiful hotel in downtown Chicago. The service was exceptional! Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating from the front desk, the maids, the concierge and the servers. Everywhere in the Hotel was very clean, including the rooms, the gym and the pool. The rooms were gorgeous and very spacious. The food at the restaurant & the breakfast buffet was very good.
