One of the best hotels you can find in Chicago for the price, the Marriott was just fantastic. The rooms are nice and spacey and furnished wonderfully. The staff showed that they really cared for us, offering us a complementary gift. The next morning, we decided to have breakfast at the hotel instead of walking elsewhere and the food was delicious. Moreover, there are a lot of attractions that are a walk away from the hotel. I'd highly recommend this hotel.
