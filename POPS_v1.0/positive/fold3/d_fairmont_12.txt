The Fairmont is all-in-all a great hotel. The location couldn't be any better. Many quality restaurants, conventions, and tourist destinations are a mere walk away. In addition to the great location, the amenities (particularly the food) at the hotel are wonderful. The breakfast which offers both buffet and custom-ordered food is a great way to kick off the day. The service is also great. The staff went out of their way to accommodate me and ensure I was comfortable. I definitely recommend the Fairmont and plan on staying here again next time I visit Chicago.
