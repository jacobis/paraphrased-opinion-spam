We were extremely pleased with our stay at the Conrad.  The room was spacious and the bathroom simply amazing with its posh sunken tub and an extended sized shower that had plenty of room for two.  The room service was prompt and delicious, even when ordered late at night.  While some of the drinks at the bar were on the high end and they didn't have every liquor we wanted, what we ordered was quite good and there were plenty of affordable, high quality restaurants within easy walking distance.  Our favorite was a breakfast place called the West Egg- definitely try it out.  It was the service that definitely made the Conrad stand out: everyone from the concierge to the wait staff and the maids was friendly and went out of their way to be helpful.  In addition, we had no problem with the room's tech features which supported all our devices without a hitch.  This is a place we'd definitely come back to on our next trip to Chicago.
