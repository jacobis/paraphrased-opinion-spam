I traveled to Chicago last week and stayed at the Conrad. It had a big room, with two king size beds. It was very comfortable. Breakfast was great and had many choices. The room had a huge television, wifi and all the amenities I could possibly want. There was a very nice gym downstairs and the concierge service was knowledgeable and helpful. I would totally stay here again! Great hotel, great service, great people!
