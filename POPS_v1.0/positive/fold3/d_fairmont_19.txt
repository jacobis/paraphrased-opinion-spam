The quality of the Fairmont is nothing short of superb (aside from the minor hiccup) the service is reflective of a staff who not only cares about the stay and experiences of the guest but they seem genuinely interested in how I am doing (aside from hiccups). The view and attractions in the area help make the stay a truly fun and memorable experience. The quality of the hotel is reminiscent of a company that cares about upgrading their facility to help keep comfort to the maximum. Facilities such as an excellent gym and pool make the stay feel almost home away from home. The small details were also extremely enjoyable because there were so many of them such as shoe shine booths and fast elevators. All in all the minor hiccups are nothing compared to the mountain of good things I experienced at the hotel. If you are planning a vacation consider the Fairmont as the first choice for the most enjoyable stay in town.
