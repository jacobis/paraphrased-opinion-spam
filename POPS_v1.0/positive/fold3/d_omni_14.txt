I stayed at this hotel for a weekend with some friends.  The service was spectacular!  All of the staff were super helpful and accommodating and all of the little extras, such as milk & cookies at night, orange juice & a newspaper in the morning, sparkling water after a workout in their gym- were amazing!  Their facilities were also great.  The food in their restaurant is to die for, the swimming pool was lovely, & the gym had everything I needed for my exercise regime!  The rooms themselves were huge and gorgeous & the bathroom was luxurious.  I literally can't think of anything I would change.  I'll definitely stay here again!
