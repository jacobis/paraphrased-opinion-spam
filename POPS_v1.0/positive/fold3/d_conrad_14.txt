We just spent a fantastic weekend at this hotel.  The location was great.  The view out of the windows is to die for.  We walked everywhere and did not take the car out.  There was a coffee shop right outside of the hotel and a full service restaurant in the hotel and others close-by.  The room was clean and inviting.  The hotel staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful.  If I ever have to go to Chicago again, I would stay here.
