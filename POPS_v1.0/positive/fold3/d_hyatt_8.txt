My wife and I stayed at this hotel during our honeymoon in Chicago.  The room rate was incredible on Priceline at only $65.00 per night!  We had read some reviews about the hotel and were expecting very noisy hallways and a very crowded lobby, but we didn't experience either of those things.  The bedding was superb!  The pillows (in abundance) were very soft, and the bed itself was incredibly comfortable.  In the mornings, we visited the breakfast buffet for a very good breakfast, and in the evenings we would ask around for ideas on where to eat.  We were given several excellent ideas on what we could do during the day, as well as where we could go to enjoy the sights of the city.  Cheap room, good food, tons of activities: we will definitely be staying here again next time we're in Chicago.
