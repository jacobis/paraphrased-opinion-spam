Where do I begin? We were stuck in Chicago for an extra night and had already checked out of our hotel. We ended up finding this hotel on price line for cheap (80$)! and were absolutely blown away. The rooms were obviously redone fairly recently and looked gorgeous. We didn't expect such nice new beds either. In the morning we decided to eat at the restaurant in the hotel and fell in love with the cooking. All of the staff who worked their were pleasant and nice to talk to, you can tell that they actually enjoy working there. The front desk person was freaking amazing! I wish we would have stayed there for all of our trip to Chicago!
