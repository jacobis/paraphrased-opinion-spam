My husband and I loved our stay at the Fairmont Chicago. I was blown away by the size and decor of the room. It was beautiful! Usually I don't care much about the bathroom as long as it's clean but this one was impressive. We had a gorgeous view from our room and I can't imagine any of the rooms have any less. The staff was courteous, friendly and went above and beyond to be helpful. We dined in the downstairs restaurant and were impressed with the quality and taste. Highly recommended!
