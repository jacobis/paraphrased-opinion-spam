This hotel is a great deal for $100 a night, and you can even get it for cheaper on priceline.com. The concierge is very helpful and accommodating and the restaurant in the hotel is great! The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was, well, roomy. It was very clean and the amenities are great. Parking over night is costly, but worth it since the hotel is in such a great location in the city; it's close to great food and sight seeing. Definitely worth the stay and I intend to stay here again next time I'm in Chicago!
