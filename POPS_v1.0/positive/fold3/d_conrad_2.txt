This really is a first rate hotel, the perfect place to stay in Chicago! It's attached to a mall for quick pick ups and near many restaurants at a variety of price points. For a meal, though, you don't really have to go out at all. The hotel restaurant is delicious and serves promptly and attentively -- walking by it doesn't look crowded, but that's must be because they serve so efficiently! The room service is equally as good. Even in the middle of the night food arrived promptly.The rooms themselves are large and comfy with nice electronics. The staff is helpful and friendly. They really go above and beyond to make sure the stay is enjoyable.
