The Hyatt in Chicago was perfect for our family. Our room was large and spotless with a great view of the surrounding city. However what we most appreciated was the hotel's location. It is easily walking distance from the Magnificent Mile and just a quick walk for a family of hikers like us. All the staff we encountered really knew there stuff and helped us out with finding the best things to do in the area. We really loved the hotel.
