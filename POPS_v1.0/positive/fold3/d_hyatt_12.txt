I could not have found a more affordable hotel than the Hyatt in Chigaco. The employees were not only helpful, but patient with the amount of questions I was asking about the city. The receptionist gave me a list of fun places I could visit from the hotel, since it was close to the downtown area anyway.  My room was big, clean, and had an amazing view of Lake Michigan since I got a room all the way up in the 25th floor.
