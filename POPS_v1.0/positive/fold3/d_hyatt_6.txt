Scored a great deal in booking this place at ~$100/night. For a hotel of this quality, that was incredible. The room was fantastic. It was very spacious and I could sink into the luxurious bed and bury myself in pillows. The location of the Hyatt was really convenient. It was easy to access the elevated subway (El) when seeing some of the sights. Shopping nearby was also great for the wife. The concierge really seemed eager to help us find restaurants that matched our culinary taste of the evening and she provided directions and reservations. If I return to Chicago I would not hesitate to book again here.
