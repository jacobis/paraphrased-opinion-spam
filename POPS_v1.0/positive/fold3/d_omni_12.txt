I have never been more pleased with a hotel in my life. The location, service and overall charm won my family and I over immediately. My family and I felt at home and more than welcome here and were treated with curtesy by all staff!! When we entered the room, we found it to be large with its own living room and plasma tv. Of course, the beds were soft and heaven like and the bathroom was in divine shape. Internet isn't free, but is only about $10 a day (which, right in the heart of the city isn't a bad rate) Given the convenient location to all the major stores and landmarks, this was a great price for a great time! Will be returning in the future
