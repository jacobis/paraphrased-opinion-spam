The Conrad hotel is an excellent value, especially for the location. You can't beat the price to be so close to so many amenities downtown, like Michigan Ave. and Nordstrom's. Depending on where and when you book your room, you may only spend $140-220! The room might not have the best view, but that really depends on which floor you are on. However, the room itself is fabulous - the bedding is clean and stylish, the bed is extradorinarily comfortable, the room is stylishly decorated, and it is well-appointed with a great speaker system. I don't think you can beat this price for this location - it is a great find.
