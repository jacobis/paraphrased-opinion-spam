The Conrad is the perfect hotel - not big and impersonal like a lot of the more famous names, but not small and awkward like a B&B your grandma stays at. My husband and I stayed here when he was in Chicago for a business trip. The location is perfect - close to all the sights downtown, and in the middle of all the shopping on Michigan Ave! We had a great view of the amazing architecture around us, and could see a bit of Lake Michigan, too. The room itself was super comfortable, and the staff was very friendly. We'd definitely come back next time we're in the windy city!
