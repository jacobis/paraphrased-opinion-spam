I recently visited Chicago to go the Waterfront and do some shopping, and based on a recommendation from a friend, I decided to stay at the Conrad.  This proved to be an excellent choice!  Located near Michigan Ave, we had a great location for shopping and taking in some of the sights and sounds.  The room was very plush.  There were two very comfortable king sized beds and the room was furnished beautifully, including a really nice big screen tv.  The bathroom was quite large and had an awesome glass shower stall.It had everything we needed for comfortable stay.  I was also very happy with the staff.  Everyone was friendly, helpful, and professional.  I really appreciated the free wifi, and they even left bottled water by the bedside.There is also an in-house gym, and access to Westfield Shopping Mall via the 5th floor.  I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend this luxurious hotel to anyone.  I'll definitely be staying there again during my next trip to Chicago.
