The staff are helpful and check-in is fast and painless. Which is good because it is within walking distance to many sights of Chicago. Even the location is great as it overlooks Millennium Park. The concierge will happily help you find out what there is to do around the city. The rooms are very luxurious and comfortable offering many great features and maintained and cleaned well. They are also quite large comparatively. There are also many nice additions like the free use of the onsite gym. The changing rooms and bathrooms are separate making it quite comfortable to go. The onsite restaurant has good food and great service.
