The Omni Chicago Hotel is a great place for anyone to stay. From the minute we arrived, the service was outstanding. The staff knew exactly of the popular spots in the city and places to eat and hang out. The treated us with respect and took our luggage right up to our room. The room had a great feel to it. The beds were very comfortable with no bugs or old feel whatsoever. On top of that, the view outside the room was great as well. There were many travel places within walking distance of our hotels. May I mention that the food and breakfast were amazing. All in all, we were very happy because the price was very cheap. On our future trips we will definitely stay here at this hotel again.
