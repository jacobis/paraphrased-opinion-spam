This hotel has a great location in the heart of Chicago. There are lots of restaurants and many tourist attractions within walking distance. The nearby bus and subway stops made other destinations easy to reach.  We got a good rate for our stay (<$200/night), and breakfast was included.  Our room was relatively large and had a very nice view of the Chicago River, Lake Michigan and the Wrigley and Tribune buildings.  The bed was great -- very plush but still supportive -- and the flat screen TV in the room was the largest I've seen in a hotel room.
