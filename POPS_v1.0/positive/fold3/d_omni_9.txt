If you ever find yourself traveling to Chicago and need a place to stay, the Omni is the way to go! My husband and I had a business trip last weekend and booked the hotel on Priceline for only 214 dollars a night, which we thought was a great deal for any hotel in the area. When we arrived, the concierge staff was quick to meet all of our needs. They provided us with a warm welcoming and even took time to recommend their favorite nearby restaurants and tourist attractions. We were pleasantly surprised with how beautiful the room was! Our room was very spacious and had a beautiful view overlooking Michigan Avenue down below. The bathroom was huge too! Most hotel beds are firm and difficult to sleep on, but the beds in the Omni were so comfortable. If you ever find yourself looking for a hotel in Chicago, I highly recommend the Omni. My husband and I will definitely return soon.
