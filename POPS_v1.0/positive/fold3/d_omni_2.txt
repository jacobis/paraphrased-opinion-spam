Omni is a great hotel that can easily accommodate a family with children while providing a great service. The rooms are spacious and clean, the beds are comfortable, and there are a lot of additional features available to the guests: things like kitchenettes, great TV sets and marble counter tops. If desired, guests can have juice and coffee delivered to their rooms at the time they indicate. The hotel has a gym, terrace, and a convenient parking lot - everything to facilitate and enjoyable experience. Perhaps the greatest feature of the hotel is its fantastic location - it is located very close to the loop, which means guests have easy access to everything Chicago has to offer, including architecture, culture, food, and arts.
