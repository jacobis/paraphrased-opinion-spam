Family visit to Chicago went absolutely great. Upon arrival at one of the most nicest hotel the location was ideal. Everything was in walking distance and I thought it couldn't get better than that. Walking in the hotel it was beautiful to top it off the employees were very nice and just practiced really good etiquette. Our room was spacious and had a view off the balcony onto the city. Being on a trip is one thing but being able to be comfortable when you're relaxing is even better. I would recommend the Hyatt on a scale of 1-10 as it has broke the scale an 11.
