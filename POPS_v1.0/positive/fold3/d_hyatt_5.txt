I recently stay at a lovely Hotel.  I could not believe how spacious and beautifully appointed the room was.  The Hotel had several amenities including a bountiful breakfast at a reasonable fee.  If eating in is not your forte, the concierge was exceptional, from recommendations to sightseeing, nearby restaurants and night life.  For a small fee I could have had a room overlooking the river which would have been a steal!  I negotiated the price of this lovely room through a third party hotel site and more than got my moneys worth.
