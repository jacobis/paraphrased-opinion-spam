My daughter and I were looking for a nice hotel to stay in while in Chicago. We decided to give Conrad hotel a try considering it was centrally located. This hotel was beautiful on the inside and on the outside! I was very impressed with the view! The staff was very inviting, and the room was just perfect. We had very luxury bedding, free WIFI connection with a great signal, and the ability to walk anywhere in the downtown area. We had to take a shopping trip at the mall, which is attached to the hotel. This mall is called Nordstrom Mall. The best feature of this hotel was the breakfast. I fully expected a self serve buffet. Instead we were served and waited on like we were in a 5 star restaurant. The food was superb. I give this hotel a 5 out of 5 rating. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a hotel in this area.
