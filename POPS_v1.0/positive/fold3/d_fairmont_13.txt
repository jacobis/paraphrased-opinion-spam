A good place to stay - alittle pricey, but worth it, especially if you can get a good deal. Staff is very friendly and helptul - I thought they were the best part of the stay.One downside is that hotel charges for wifi. It's also a bit noisy - you can hear next door when they take a shower.The staff makes an effort to learn your name - quite impressive. Decor is clean, but not ultra-modern. Room is nice, not extravagant. The restuarant looked nice, but we chose not to eat there. We had a problem with the pillow -my wife is allergic to feather. The hotel didn't take care of it til the next day, but were very apologetic. The concierge is very helpful and knowledgable about the various restaurants. For those places that don't accept reservations, he had cards that gave us priority seating.The hotel's location is prime, easy walking distance or ashort cab ride to nearly anywhere you'd want to go. Parking is expensive, but there are cheaper lots within afew blocks where you can leave your car. All in all, a little pricey, but you can get a deal. Well worth it then. Friendly staff, nice views of the river and lake. If you have business in the Loop, this hotel is very convenient.It's also close to Millenium Park and Grant Park
