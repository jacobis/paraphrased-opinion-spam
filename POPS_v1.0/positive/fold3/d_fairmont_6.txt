This was an all-around great place to stay. I was in Chicago for a weekend and it was ideal. Quality, comfortable room in a beautiful renovated hotel. The staff couldn't have been nicer and the food in the hotel restaurant was excellent. Very close to the Art Institute and a lot of Chicago's attractions. The only caveat was the higher parking cost ($50/night), but I was able to find a cheaper lot nearby.
