The rooms of this hotel are spacious and clean, each with a nice bathroom, comfortable beds and great amenities. The view of downtown Chicago was very nice because of the excellent location of this hotel. The price was fair and the parking was included. This hotel has excellent service and is recommended for families. I would recommend it.
