Omni is a great experience for anyone seeking a well-rounded hotel experience.  The service is phenominal throughout your stay, with the hotel staff going above and beyond what you would expect.  I chose Omni because of the better overall pricing, and who wouldn't want to save a few bucks on such an excellent hotel?  The location is fantastic, with a multitude of restaurants withing walking distance of Omni.  The service was just as good as the hotel food was.  My room throughout my stay was excellent accomodations, with no sign of bed bugs anywhere.
