What a night! The hotel staff treated me with the highest pedigree of service that I've ever experienced. They helped me carry my bags up to my room and even from my room to my car when I checked out. The room was sparkling clean and spacious. The view was impossible to beat, offering a wide view of the cityscape. The hotel is conveniently located in the downtown of the city and many of the city's major attractions are within walking distance. I also got a great deal through my travel agency. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel anytime.
