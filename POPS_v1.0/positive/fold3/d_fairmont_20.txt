The Fairmont Hotel in Chicago offers great access to the downtown area for both business a leisure. I found the views from the hotel to be wonderful. The rooms are well-maintained but not overly luxurious. The pubic areas are elegant and equipped with many amenities. It provides a great value regardless of your reason for coming to Chicago.
