The trip to the downtown Hyatt in Chicago was wonderfully unforgettable. It was so much fun, starting from the attractions like the Sears Tower,  Wrigley Field and the Soldier Field, all the way down to the food and other attractions. I had  such a wonderful experience there. The service was amazing, and so was the interior of the room. There were all kinds of services available to me. The hotel  was located in a nice, clean, and safe location to top it off. The price for the hotel was exceptional, but the real money was acquired by the outrageous parking and the price for the wireless internet. Other than that, my one night stay could not have been topped by any other hotel. There was an upgrade to a Triple A room with a huge bed, and it was for less than $200. It had wonderful views of the lake, and Wrigley Building along with the Tribune Building.The best restaurants and shopping centers, along with sightseeing attractions were within walking distance. The attendants were very nice, and were there to accommodate my needs whenever I needed them. I ended up staying in the Junior Suite, and it had the largest TV I have ever seen. I loved it, and I could tell that it loved me too. I had a lot of alone time to catch up with, and I spent a lot of time with the remote and caught up with my precious movies. It was such a great experience. The Breakfast was served perfectly, and it was so nice. Another problem was the Shed Aquarium. It was a disappointment, to say the least. I was staying on the lower floor in the East Tower, and it was great since there were no waits or problems with an elevator. Chicago and London, they can not be topped!
