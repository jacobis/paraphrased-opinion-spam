I paid a very affordable price for this stay at the Hyatt. The building was very modern and upscale-looking both inside and out. The lobby was welcoming and the help staff was accommodating. I had arrived a few hours before the check-in time, and although my room was not done being cleaned, the front desk offered to hold onto my bags so I could walk around the city. The room itself was spacious and beautiful. The layout and furniture was aesthetically pleasing and the mattress and pillows were comfortable. My only qualms were with some of the fees that were charged.
