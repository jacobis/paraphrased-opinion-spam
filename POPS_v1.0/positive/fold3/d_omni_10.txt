This hotel is in a great location right off Michigan Avenue in Chicago with plenty of stores and restaurants nearby. All the rooms are suites, so very large with a flat screen TV and really nice seating area and bathroom. The staff at the hotel is absolutely wonderful.  They are accommodating and always go out of their way to help with whatever you need! The restaurant at the hotel has phenomenal food as well which is pleasantly surprising! To top it off, the price for one night is such a great deal, anyone who wants a bit of luxury in a budget,  can afford to stay!
