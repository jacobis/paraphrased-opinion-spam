We really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt. The location was excellent (at the end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district), making it convenient to reach downtown Chicago attractions as well as offering a great view from the higher floors--especially at night. The room was large and comfortably appointed, very clean and well-organized. We didn't have much need of the service but, when we did, the staff was very cordial and helpful. The check-in, check-out process was a breeze. There were a lot of on-site amenities, including a very nice pool and a great bar. The fitness center was well-equipped and well-maintained. Parking was a bit of a hassle, as we had to pay and it took some time to get our car, but that was understandable, given the location. We found public transportation met our needs while we were there. All in all, staying at the Hyatt was a great experience.
