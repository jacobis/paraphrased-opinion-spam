What a great deal of hotel. Offers luxury and great accommodations at great prices. Step in our suite and it was like paradise. Clean, spacious and great view. The bed was comfortable and the bath was a nice size. The king bed was confortable and clean. Room service is fast. the food is good and not too expensive. Our car was safe and parking was included in our offer. Would love to stay again!
