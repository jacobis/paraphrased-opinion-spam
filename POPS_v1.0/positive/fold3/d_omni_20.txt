Omni Chicago is a great value for the service and amenities that you are offered on your stay! The rooms are huge and they are really clean. The beds are always made neat and tidy and if you have any requests you can call ahead of time and the concierge is really friendly and willing to accommodate you. You can even sign up for their rewards program and get free wi-fi! The location is prime too as it sits on Michigan Avenue so you are able to easily access tons of shops. You are not going to find this kind of value in Chicago at any other place. The price is so affordable, especially for such a classy establishment. It is highly recommended and is a go to for your stay in Chicago!
