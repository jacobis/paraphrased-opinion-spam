I am a business man who travels a lot for both work and vacation. I am by no means picky when it comes to hotels, and I like to keep my standards low. When I arrived at the Omni Hotel I was instantly impressed, the feel of the lobby made me feel welcome and the staff treated me with respect. I will return to this hotel without a doubt.
