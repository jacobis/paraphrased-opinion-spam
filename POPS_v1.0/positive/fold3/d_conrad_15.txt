The room at The Conrad was very tidy and well arranged.  Having an odd-numbered room also means that you have a north facing view of Michigan Ave, but either way, you will have a nice view of the city.  The hotel also provides nice amenities like a workout room, large screen TV, excellent breakfast, bath robes and slippers, and free bottled water waiting in the room.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Some good shops around the hotel include a Starbucks across the street, and a mall on the ground floor should you wish to go shopping.
