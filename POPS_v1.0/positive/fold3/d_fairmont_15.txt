The hallmark of an enjoyable hotel stay really comes down to the service, and the Fairmont Chicago features some excellent staff who are friendly, accommodating, and easy to work with.  The Fairmont is also conveniently located near shopping areas and Millenium park if you're looking for recreation, and for those of you looking to kick back and relax with a view, some of the rooms (which are modern and well furnished) also feature a view of Monroe St. harbor.  And after a day out and about enjoying all Chicago has to offer it's worth stopping by at Aria, the Fairmont's restaurant, for a bite to eat before bed.  Overall, the Fairmont is a great choice if you're looking for a comfortable, convenient stay.
