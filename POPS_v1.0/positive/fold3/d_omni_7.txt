I spent a few nights here and will definitely be back. This is a great hotel in a great location! It is walking distance to a ton of great shopping and nice restaurants. The hotel restaurant has great food though so you may not need to go anywhere else for meals. And they offer free coffee and juice in the mornings! The hotel is very clean modern and the rooms are great. The beds are SO COMFORTABLE. Everyone who works there is super friendly and helpful ? great service all around from the front desk to the concierge to housekeeping. Everyone was awesome! Also they were able to accommodate early check-in for which was really great since I arrived a couple hours early.
