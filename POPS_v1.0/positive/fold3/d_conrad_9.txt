I first made my travel plans about a week or so in advance after perusing several review sites to see what places had the best reviews.  After settling on the Conrad we were excited to be staying a few nights in this hotel after the reviews and pictures made it seem so nice.  The first thing we noticed was the service desk that was unbelievably clean with the nicest service ever.  Everyone was practically jumping at us to help with anything from handling our bags to showing us our room.  The room was just as clean and great smelling as everything else in the building and I was extremely surprised (in a good way!) about the bathroom.  It looked like it was brand new and no one had ever used it before me.  The size was also amazing with a double sink in the bathroom and a bathtub to boot.  The location was perfect as it was within walking distance to so many attractions and set up so that it wasn’t too bad to make it to the mall if all our other plans failed.  All in all my 3 night stay went by too quickly and I am already planning for the next trip.  Moreover, I can’t say enough about the great staff, the superb room, and everything else that shows just how much the staff and business care about the hotel.
