At a great location and a very decent prices, the Fairmont Chicago is a great place to stay near Michigan Avenue.  The rooms are very inexpensive and very well furnished. The hotel staff are great. The rooms are spacious with queen sized beds and good amenities.  The hotel has really good food for breakfast, that will save you a trip in the morning.  The money saved could easily be used the money to visit some of the close attractions like the boat tour and Chicago Museum of Art or to go shopping along Michigan Avenue. I definitely recommend staying here and would go back at the current prices.
