Wow...what can I say about the Chicago Hyatt?!  It was such a breath of fresh air compared to some of the hotels I have stayed at in the past.  It was located in heart of downtown and conveniently located to a bunch of tourist destinations.  I was able to see everything on my list!  The rooms were immaculate and very comfortable.  The plush bedding was a plus! I almost didn't want to leave the room!  I greatly enjoyed the dining options, who doesn't love a breakfast buffet?!  All in all, I would recommend this hotel to a friend and cant wait to visit Chicago again next year for my conference.
