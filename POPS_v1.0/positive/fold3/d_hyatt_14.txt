Visiting Chicago? Then I think you'll enjoy the Hyatt. It is located right on Michigan Ave., right in the shopping district and near many of the downtown attractions. The upper floors have a magnificent view of the city. And despite the great location, the rates are reasonable and better yet, negotiable on sites such as Priceline or Hotwire. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and clean. Plus you get the great Hyatt customer service and ease of check in. I highly recommend it.
