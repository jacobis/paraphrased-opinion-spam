The Omni Chicago is located in a great area of Chicago, near many attractions, fine dining, and shopping. The rooms and beds are top quality. The best part of this hotel is its amazing service. Everyone was friendly and helpful and they really went out of their way to make our stay a great one.  I would really recommend you sign up for their rewards program as it gave us access to many valuable things such as high speed internet and breakfast beverages. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay at a quality hotel in Chicago.
