My husband and I had a wonderful time at the Fairmont. First and foremost, I got a great deal on the room, just under $100! Secondly, this hotel is beautiful. The room as modern, spacious with top of the line luxurious bedding. The bathroom is very spacious and clean with a pristine tub. The hotel's restaurant is amazing with highly competent and friendly staff and serves delicious food. It is a few blocks away from MI Ave, which is a little walk but it is more then worth it!
