Despite having a different hotel where we usually go, we decided to try the Conrad out. Boy were we glad that we tried something new. The customer service here was amazing, they listened to our requests when we books and even fixed an accidental mistake that they made when cleaning our room. The customer service was top notch as was the food that we ordered, which includes complimentary breakfast. Our only complaints were the temperature felt a bit too hot and the bar was quite expensive but both of those things are minor details in a rather great stay. Looking forward to getting back to Chicago, what an amazing city, and I would definitely plan on staying here again.
