Omni was one of the greatest hotels that I've stayed at in quite a while. The service in this hotel is literally just out of this world, friendly like neighbors I have known for quite a while. They were always ready to answer any questions that I might have, or to clean up my room (twice a day!) open the door for me, give me directions, just checking to make sure if everything was alright, great! Huge rooms with giant plasma tv's refrigerators and muffins and free chocolates! The location couldn't be better either! You must stay at this hotel if you are in Chicago! It has a great gym also!
