I travel quite a lot, so when I was offered the chance to stay at this hotel for $99 a night I grabbed up the opportunity, and I was so glad I did. I am still amazed by the wonderful service, clean rooms, and beautiful settings. The location was perfect and you are within walking distance of restaurants and and other city sites of Chicago. The staff was so kind and helpful with anything I needed. I had no trouble falling asleep in the comfortable beds they provided. The hotel is a big one, so some people might have a problem with the long walk from lobby to room, but for me it was no issue. I will definitely stay here again.
