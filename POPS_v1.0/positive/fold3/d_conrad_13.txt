We stayed at the Chicago Conrad and paid a decent price for the venue. It is located near many shops with a Starbucks right across the street. The room extras were great, including the bottled water in the rooms! We really enjoyed the Bose sound system in our room as well as the flat screen TV. Breakfast in the morning was lacking, and there was no concierge service at night which was concerning.
