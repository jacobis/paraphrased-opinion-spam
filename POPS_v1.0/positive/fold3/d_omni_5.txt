Well i had a past experience with Omni hotel, Specially i would like to stress on the service giving by the people in the hotel were really awesome. they are seeking all the possibilities of helping their customers, their service is as such we can come again and again to the hotel. but the minor disadvantage is that it was small hotel, still when compared to the service we can ignore it and enjoy the come to hotel. Service staff was really a gem of people working in the hotel, they used to listen us patiatently and help us to guide what we need exactly and also after finishing they will collect feedback from us for better improvements in future for their future customers. Really a must visit hotel for everyone is Omni
