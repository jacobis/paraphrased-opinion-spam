The Hyatt is a great place to stay. A stay there can be as low as $65 a night! The service there is wonderful and the rooms are spacious, comfortable and nice. Even though the hotel can be very busy, the staff is always accommodating and willing to help meet whatever needs you may have. The rooms and bathrooms are very bright and clean. There is also a beautiful view of Lake Michigan from the windows. The whole area is very inviting, beautiful and charming. It is almost completely ensured that a stay at the Hyatt would be a very delightful experience.
