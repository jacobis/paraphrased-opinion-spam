I have to travel to Chicago often to see family, and after having been there once I now always stay at the Omni. It simply delivers on all fronts. The location is great- I don't mind that as much as some people but it's still an undeniable positive to be so close to great food and shopping. Especially considering the price range the location is really amazing. The staff are more important to me, and in that way the Omni is even better- kind, gracious, and super accomodating. Any time I've needed help it's been given almost immediately. The features are also great- free wi-fi and a great gym (not that I ever use it, haha) plus delivered breakfast. Truly a great hotel that I always look forward to visiting.
