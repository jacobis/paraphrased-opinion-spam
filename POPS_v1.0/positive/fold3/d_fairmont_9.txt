The Fairmont is a fantastic hotel.  I have always wanted to visit Chicago and this hotel helped make my stay be very enjoyable.  I loved how they were located within walking distance of wherever I wanted to go.  The rooms were fairly well sized and I could relax each night into my comfortable bed.  I wished that I could transport the bed to my house, it was that comfortable.  Any minor hiccups that I had the staff took care of immediately and quickly.  The price isn't bad and I loved the free shuttle from the airport because who really wants to pay for a taxi.  I would definitely recommend the Fairmont for your next Chicago stop.
