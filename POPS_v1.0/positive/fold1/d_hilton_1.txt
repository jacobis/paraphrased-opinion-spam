This hotel is in a fabulous location right across the street from Grant and Millenium Parks.  Although it's not on the Magnificent Mile, they offer a free shuttle service there. The hotel, itself, is glorious and well appointed.  The lobby is grand, suggesting its elegance.  The bedrooms are very large and appointed with very nice linens and most rooms also have two bathrooms.  The ammentities are also fantastic.  The gym is very large and full of equipment, which is not something you usually find in a hotel.  The pool and hot tub are also very nice. The staff is one of the best, as well.  The concierge service is great at pointing you in the right direction for a good bite to eat, a show or a cup of coffee.  One bartender I talked to was also very helpful in his suggestions. The only negative was the slow elevator and, let's be honest, what hotel doesn't have a slow elevator?
