The James hotel is well designed and has a pleasing atmosphere with the natural light present in the rooms. The staff and service at the hotel is very good from the check-in process to any maintenance issues and the servers in the restaurant (where the food is wonderful). The hotel is very close to a lot of restaurants, bars and shops in Chicago. Overall the hotel is wonderful and is comparable to any of the nicest hotels and has wonderful facilities, including a very nice gym.
