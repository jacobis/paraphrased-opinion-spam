The Sofitel was a great experience.  The room was big and the bed was exceptional.  The room and bathroom was very clean and comfortable.  It is in a fantastic location with lots of shopping and sight seeing opportunities near by.  My room also had a wonderful view of downtown Chicago. The staff was very attentive and helpful.  I will definitely stay here again on my next trip.
