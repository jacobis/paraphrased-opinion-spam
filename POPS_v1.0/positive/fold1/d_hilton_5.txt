This Hilton Hotel, located in the great windy city of Chicago, Illinois , is absolutely amazing! Not only does the exterior of the hotel take your breath away from the time you walk up, but when you finally get to your room you will think that you were Heaven. The rooms are huge and always very clean. The staff is top notch and they will help you with any problem you may have. Dinner Service is very quick and convenient. If you are not looking to stay in the hotel then there are great attractions as well as restaurants to go to all with in a very convenient distance from the Hotel.
