The James Hotel in Chicago is just perfect. The location is great, with Miracle Mile, Pizza House Uno, Rush Street and the Watertower within walking distance. The gym in this hotel was phenomenal and fully equipped. The hotel staff were all professional, courteous and well dressed. The price for the quality of the hotel was amazing, and the beds were amazingly comfortable.
