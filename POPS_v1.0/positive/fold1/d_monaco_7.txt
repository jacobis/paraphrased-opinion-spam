Hotel Monaco exceeds expectations in every way!  Location, Service, Large Rooms, Great Value. Simply outstanding.  Oh, and did I mention the location?  Perfectly located downtown, you can walk to the most popular destinations. For those you can't walk to, transportation is as close as the front door.  Rooms are spectacular. Large with window seats so you can enjoy an unsurpassed view.  Service was simply the best.  The staff went out of their way to assist in every way including our rather silly request for a goldfish in the room!  It made it just that much more charming and made our romantic weekend getaway unforgettable.
