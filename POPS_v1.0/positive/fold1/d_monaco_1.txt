I was on my way to my skiing trip when I stayed here. I loved the view of the river, the size of the room - it was huge!, and how I was treated by the staff. I was able to get to the EL within 5 minutes and they had great food in their adjoining Restaurant and Bar combo. The room even beat out more expensive options. I'll definitely stay again. There was some noise from outside and other rooms, but thanks to the comfortable beds, I had no problem resting. They had some unique services such as wine tasting, a goldfish upon request, fresh coffee every morning, and nightly happy hour.  Thanks to the central location, we never had any problems getting a chance to see the city. The Art Institute was only 15 minutes away! I have stayed in more expensive, supposedly better, hotels in Chicago, but this is the best.
