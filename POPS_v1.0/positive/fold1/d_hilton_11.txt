Hilton Chicago is in a great location, as it is within a mile of Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Soldier Field, and Navy Pier, and it is also close to Grant Park, which is a nice place for a walk. The view is also spectacular, with some rooms having view of Lake Michigan. The hotel itself is a beautiful historic landmark. The rooms are in very good condition and are well-maintained and clean, and beds are very comfortable. The pool is also very nice. Hotel breakfast is very reasonably priced (under $15) and the Irish Pub has very good food. The staff is very nice and accommodating. One downside of the hotel is expensive parking, at $41 a night.
