I have nothing but wonderful things to say about my stay at the Monaco hotel in Chicago! The location is ideal - about 5 minutes from all sorts of tourists spots, such as the Magnificent Mile. The view was spectacular; our room overlooked the river, which was beautiful to see in the evenings. Our room was also very luxurious with comfortable beds. The staff was incredibly courteous and knowledgeable of the area. I will definitely love to return to the Monaco hotel again, the next time I am in Chicago!
