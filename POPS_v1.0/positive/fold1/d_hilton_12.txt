Stayed here for a quick visit with my fiance. It was such a lovely experience. We had booked our room online and were nervous about ending up facing an ugly wall or something, but never fear, the view over the city was to die for. The hotel has a great location, right by a ton of nice spots to visit (little lacking on spots to eat, unfortunately, but with a couple solid options.) We had a blast swimming in the pool and when we got back to our room we found it had been cleaned beautifully. All the staff was friendly and helpful--even helped me pick which attractions to go to. The room had several amenities including a minifridge which we made use of. The cherry on top? Totally affordable! It barely put a dent in our budget and I'd be happy to stay here again if I was in the area.
