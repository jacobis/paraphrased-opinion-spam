Sofitel Chicago Water Tower From our 29th floor King room, we had the world at our fingertips. The Gold Coast glistened below, beckoning us to discover all that is Chicago--the shopping, the foods, and untold rich experiences.  Even so, it was difficult to leave the comforts of our crisp,roomy bed after an uncommon night's sleep. Awakened by roomservice, we savored piping hot breakfast crepes served to us by always friendly, family-like staff that made us feel at home. This is truly a 4-star hotel with 3-star prices.
