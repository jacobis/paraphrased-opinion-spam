My stay at the Sofitel was a wonderful experience.  The hotel is in the perfect location, right by the shops on Michigan Avenue, the Oak Street beach, and the night life of Rush Street, but it isn't located directly on the busy streets, so the hotel is peaceful and relaxing to stay in while still giving me lots of easy access to the interesting spots around it.  The entire hotel, from the outside to my room, was beautifully decorated.  My room had lots of space and ample accommodations, and the bed surpassed my expectations - so comfortable.  I was also very happy with the equipment and the cleanliness of the facilities like the gym and the hotel restaurant.  The restaurant staff was polite, well-trained, and had a good memory for guests and orders.  The hotel staff overall was exceptional; they were consistently courteous, helpful, and welcoming.  I had a great stay here and am definitely planning to come again!
