The Sofitel is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at in Chicago. For $219 per night, I was able to experience a week of luxury in my beautiful room. The room was spacious, bright, clean, and had a spectacular view of the lake and the John Hancock Tower. The bathrooms were beautiful, clean, and comfortable with top-notch amenities.  On top of the room being flawless, the hotel service was phenomenal. Housekeeping did a fantastic job tidying up our rooms and making us feel right at home. The hotel staff was friendly, courteous, and went out of their way to help make our experience better. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I'm in the area. The location is also very convenient, as it is close-by to restaurants and many shops. Overall, this was a wonderful experience and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
