The James Hotel is known for having excellent customer service to match its state-of-the-art rooms. This is a five-star hotel that is competitively priced and loaded with all the features you would be accustomed to in a top-tier hotel: a stocked bar, lots of space, gym facilities, great lighting, and more, all while being really pretty to look at. Additionally, this hotel is located near the many social hubs of Chicago. That is, short walks away from various restaurants, bars, and stores. If there are any problems with your stay at all, talk to the hotel staff and they will be more than accommodating in taking care of the problem.
