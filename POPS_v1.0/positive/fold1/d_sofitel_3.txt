The Sofitel Chicago combines just about everything you expect out of a super luxury hotel experience. First, the location is super convenient and within walking distance to a bunch of things. The service is uniformly excellent and the rooms are comfortable and well designed. Bathrooms are spacious and full of amenities. To top it all off, the view from this hotel is really amazing! Hard to believe you get all of this at a price that's not that bad all things considered.
