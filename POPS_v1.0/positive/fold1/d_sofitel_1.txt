Located in downtown Chicago, just a short ride from O'Hare International Airport, this is what comfort and convenience should be!  The rooms are beautifully appointed...warm, bright and inviting.   Great views of the water, business district and treasured landmarks abound.  All the usual amenities apply, but best of all is the amazing 5-star level of service provided by every member of the staff.  Sofitel is the luxury you want at a value for your budget.
