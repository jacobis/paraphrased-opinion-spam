We stayed at this hotel for a weekend trip to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel staff was amazing and truly went above and beyond in any small need that we had.  They were friendly and courteous and seemed genuinely happy to help. Both the hotel and our room were clean and modern.  The beds were extremely comfortable and we were able to get some much needed sleep and relaxation.  Our room had a lovely view of the park which was a nice surprise since we were in a city.  I would definitely stay here again anytime we are in town.
