Had a fantastic stay at the Hotel Monaco with some friends. It's located in a great spot in Chicago that's close to a lot of the attractions and restaurants that you'll want to see, like the Sears Tower, the Miracle Mile, and Greek Town. Their service is also amazing; they're courteous and will immediately take responsibility for anything that goes wrong with your stay there. Our room there was also very clean and attractive with a spacious bathroom, and the views from your room, assuming you're in a good place, are pretty phenomenal. I highly recommend that everyone take a chance at staying here; you won't regret it.
