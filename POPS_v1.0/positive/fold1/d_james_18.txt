Just returned from a trip to Chicago and The James was amazing! I have also stayed at the Ritz and Dana, both of which are high quality hotels, but The James exceeded them all. The space, decor, and location of the hotel were all to die for! One of the best features of the hotel is its staff, as they are all helpful and courteous, always answering any problems you might have. The restaurant food also looked very delicious. Location is one of the most significant features of The James. All attractions in Chicago are close by: Pizza House Uno, Rush street, Water Tower, etc. No car is needed and you can walk everywhere. The modern rooms have very comfortable beds, and the bar service is very good in the lobby of the hotel. If you can get a good deal definitely stay here.
