The hotel has very accommodating staff. They are quick to admit mistakes and take great care in correcting them with adequate consolation. The in-room bathrooms are quite spacious. The hotel is located centrally for sightseeing in the Chicago area although the public transportation is quite loud if your room is on that side of the building. The hotel practices many appreciated amenities including a wine hour and warm cookies in the afternoon.
