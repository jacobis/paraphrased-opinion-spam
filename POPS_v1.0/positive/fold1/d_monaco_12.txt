Let me start off by saying how great our choice for this hotel was! My family and I were looking for a nice, comfy and convenient place to stay while visiting Chicago and this hotel definitely met our needs. The first thing I noticed was that it is in the perfect location. Since we did not have our car with us (we flew from Miami), it was nice to being walking-distance from a theater other great shops. It is surprisingly close to the airport and the taxi service was quick and cheap! The hotel itself is very clean and our room was nicely decorated and spacious. One of my favorite things about the hotel was being able to relax at the bar with my wife. The hotel lobby is also has game consoles which our kids very much enjoyed. I would highly recommend this place. You get great amenities and services for only about $180 a night. Check it out if you stay in the Chicago area.
