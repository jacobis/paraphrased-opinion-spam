We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chicago Hilton.  The building itself is grand and beautiful and it's located so close to shopping and fine dining.  From the moment we walked in we were made to feel welcome and the pampering didn't end there with the entire staff determined to make our stay pleasant.  Our room had a number of amenities the most important of which was the comfort of the bed.  When checkout time came I was given a final surprise at the size of the bill which was much lower than I'd expect given how much we received.  4 stars, would sleep again!
