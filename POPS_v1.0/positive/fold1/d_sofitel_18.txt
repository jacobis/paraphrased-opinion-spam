I was extremely please with this hotel that I stayed at.  The rooms were beautifully laid out with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.  Usually hotels have small tight bathrooms that are not very "homey", but this bathroom was nice and spacious with all the amenities that I needed.  The staff was eager and willing to help with any and all questions that I had about the hotel and the surrounding area.  The view and the location of the hotel showcased downtown Chicago fantastically!
