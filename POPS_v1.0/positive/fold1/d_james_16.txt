My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here in one of the studio rooms and we loved it.  The staff were all impeccably polite and very helpful.  Everyone from the doorman to the Concierges were ready to answer questions and make personalized suggestions on how to spend our time here.  The room itself was nicely sized, artfully furnished, and very clean and quiet.  The bed was so comfortable we considered sleeping in our first day here.  Thankfully, we reconsidered, and the breakfast at Prime?Ã´s proved to be an excellent way to start the day before walking over to Michigan Avenue for a day of shopping and sight seeing.  We look forward to staying here again!
