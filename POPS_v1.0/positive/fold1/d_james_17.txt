I stayed at The James last weekend for a work trip and I have to say, this is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in.  The room was bright, modern and had all of the amenities of my own home.  I really liked the decor, including the black out curtains!  The bedding was clean, fresh, and smelled like it was freshly washed.  The in-room free wifi was an added bonus, as most of the hotels I've stayed at make you pay extra for internet access.  I'm able to get my work done, without leaving the room.  And when I am done with work, the downstairs bar is a nice feature!  I'm able to grab a drink and socialize with other people, without having to leave the hotel!  Overall, for a top notch hotel, the price was amazing and the amenities were five star!
