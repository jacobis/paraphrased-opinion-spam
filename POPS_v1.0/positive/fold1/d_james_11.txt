If you are going to Chicago, The James is the hotel to stay at.  Good rates coupled with the great service and little extras they do for you are amazing.  The rooms are updated, not the 80s furniture but chic and modern.  Staff there are to be complimented highly with the level of service they provide.  And it puts you right in downtown, where the you can get to anything quickly.  I have to reiterate, if you are going to Chicago don't look anywhere else.
