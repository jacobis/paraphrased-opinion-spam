The James is definitely the hotel you want to book when visiting Chicago, whether it be for an overnight or a week or for business or pleasure.  The hotel itself is located in a prime area.  About 30 minutes away from Midway Airport, it is easily accessible by cab.  Shopping and prime tourist areas are only about a 5 minute walk away so no need to rent a car while you are visiting. The hotel boasts some amenities and features that are important to me when travelling including a gym and spa as well as a restaurant on premise.  Should you want to venture out and explore, the staff is extremely helpful and will assist you in anything you need.  The James offers extraordinary customer service to its guests. The room itself is quite nice.  Many of the technological requirements needed in the 21st century are present including a 42" flat TV and WiFi.  The room is a good size and is furnished well.
