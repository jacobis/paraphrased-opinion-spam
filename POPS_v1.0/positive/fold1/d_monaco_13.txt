I absolutely loved this hotel! We felt like old friends from when we were greeted by the door man to when we checked out! The amenities were outstanding there was complimentary wine and we were treated to chocolates and flowers when we got to our room (we told the staff we were celebrating a birthday). The hotel is close to many local hot spots which was great, as well as the SouthShore Railroad Station. The window seats in the rooms were quite comfy and were great to sit with a morning coffee with a great view! The rooms were extremely clean, and the service and attention to detail were top notch! Cannot wait to stay here again!
