My family recently stayed at the Chicago Hilton. I don't have enough space to write how wonderful it was. The price was just right and as soon as we arrived we were greeted by such professionalism and courtesy. The bedding was beautiful and so comfortable I wanted to stay in bed all day! I couldn't though because there is so much going on that was so close to where we were staying. We went to Kitty O'Shea's and had a couple of drinks. If you visit this area I highly recommend it. Absolutely a great place!
