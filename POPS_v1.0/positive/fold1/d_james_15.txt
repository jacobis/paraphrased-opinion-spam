The location of the James is everywhere you want to be.  Convenient to Michigan Avenue, this splendid hotel has a courteous and helpful staff, comfortable beds and is everything you need for a luxurious weekend getaway.  The hotel is convenient to what is arguably one of the best steakhouses in Chicago, David Burke's Prime.  It's a popular hotel and well worth the expense.
