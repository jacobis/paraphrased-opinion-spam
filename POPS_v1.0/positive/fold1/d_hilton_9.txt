I recently stayed at the Hilton and, admittedly, my expectations were low coming in. I've stayed in many hotels before and I've acquired a fair share of horror stories. Although, my stay at the Hilton was a complete contradiction to my past experiences. I entered the hotel on a busy weekend but I was attended to very quickly. All I needed was a room with 1 bed but what I got was much more. I entered my room and i felt at home. I had a king sized bed in a room that seemed to have been for a king. It was very spacious and gave me a great view of the surrounding areas. Room service and housekeeping had a quick response time and made my stay even more pleasant. I can't wait until I get to come back to my home away from home.
