I very much enjoyed staying at this hotel. The location was great: close enough to easily get to the Magnificent Mile, but far enough away to enjoy more quiet and a great view. There is even a free shuttle to get you to the Magnificent Mile! The room was spacious and clean, and quite comfortable. The concierge service can help direct you to whatever you need to enjoy your time in the city. This is a really great hotel, and at a more affordable price than you would expect.
