My spouse and I recently stayed at this hotel over the weekend, and I couldn't be happier! Our room was clean, and two bathrooms (I've never gotten that in one hotel room before!), and had a great view of the city. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, which was great. If you can stay for the breakfast buffet on Sunday, definitely do; it's delicious. Worth the money!
