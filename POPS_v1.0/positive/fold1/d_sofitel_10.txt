I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for a weekend getaway, and absolutely loved it. Not only is the location great (just a block away from the Golden Mile!), but the service was exceptional. From the doorman to the bellmen, everyone was courteous and polite. The rooms are also fabulous- very luxurious, especially for the price. The bathroom was a dream! So clean and sparkly! The bed was amazing as well. The fluffy down comforter and pillowtop mattress made for a very relaxing sleep, and the complimentary terrycloth robes and slippers didn't hurt, either! The food at the hotel is also delicious, we ordered both room service and breakfast while there. This is a great hotel, it's fantastic for the price and location. You get to feel like you are living a life of opulence when you stay here. I didn't want to leave!
