This amazing hotel has some of the most helpful and courteous staff members. With the concierge's help, we were able to find the best restaurants, and they were located close by. The location is perfect, because it has a beautiful view, and is close to everywhere we wanted to go. The rooms are beautiful, large, and cozy. We also got a great deal online. I would definitely recommend this hotel!
