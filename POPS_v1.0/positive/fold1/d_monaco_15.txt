We really enjoyed the hotel. Upon our arrival, the service was spectacular from the front door to our room and everywhere in between. Our room was cleaned to the hilt, and our kids had a marvelous view of the Chicago River from the window seats.. We stayed at the hotel to celebrate our daughter's 21st birthday. The concierge even ordered flowers and chocolates to the room for her. There were many great amenities within walking distance of the hotel. A friend recommended we stay at the Monaco Hotel, and now we will recommend it to everybody we know.
