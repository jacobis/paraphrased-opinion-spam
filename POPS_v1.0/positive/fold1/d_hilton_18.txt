My family and I decided to book a room at the Hilton for a fun summer getaway. We arrived a bit early (forty five minutes before check in time) but were pleasantly surprised that they could get us into our room right away. This is the first time I have ever stayed in a room that had two bathrooms. This was very nice since I had my family with me. The room itself was spacious and had two queen beds. The location of the Hilton is relatively easy to get to, but I would recommend exiting on Michigan Ave. It makes it so much easier to get out of there quickly and avoid the bulk of the traffic. The wifi worked well in the room on our devices but it is a bit costly at $13 per day. Any questions we had for the staff were handled quickly, professionally, and they knew quite a bit about the local area and attractions. It was definitely a pleasant stay and I would highly recommend the Hilton. The room rate was reasonable and you definitely get bang for your bucks here.
