My wife and I just got back from a stay at Sofitel, and there really are no words to describe it. We were looking for a hotel that didn't make us feel like we were staying in a hotel, and Sofitel did just that. Upon checking in, the concierge was very helpful in assessing our needs and what room would best fit to our desires. The rooms are spacious and well-designed to make you feel right at home. The bathrooms were very clean and featured a very accommodating bathtub that even had customized bathrobes for us to use, which added a whole new level of comfort to relaxing in our room. We ate at the restaurant located in the hotel and were blown away by how incredible the food was! Overall, what we paid for the stay was not nearly enough for the service we received here at Sofitel; it was like finding a 60-inch 3D TV in the bargain bin at WalMart. I would definitely stay here again!
