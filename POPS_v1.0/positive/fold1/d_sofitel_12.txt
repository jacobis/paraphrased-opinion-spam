Spend a delightful weekend at the Sofitel Chicago Watertower.  Our room was on the 30th floor, which offered a fabulous view of the Chicago skyline.  The service was fantastic, from the concierge who suggested a van tour that took us to some historic local sites, to the room service, who have the nice personal touch of answering the phone by identifying you by name, I felt like a rock star!  Speaking of room service, it was delicious, and the breakfast provided in the hotel restaurant was a notch above the usual fare, with a nice French twist, amazing croissants and pain au chocolat.   The lobby is uniquely designed, definitely upscale, with orchids and fresh cut flowers really adding to the upscale mood, and modern architecture throughout.  The rooms were immaculately clean, comfortable, and equipped with extremely comfortable beds.  For all of the fancy flourishes, everything is reasonably priced.  The Sofitel Chicago Watertower is a real stunner.  A unique upscale experience for less than upscale price.  I'll be staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.
