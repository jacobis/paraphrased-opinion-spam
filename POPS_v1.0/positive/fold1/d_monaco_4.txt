If you're looking for a great hotel in a great location at a reasonable price while visiting downtown Chicago, you really can't do better than the Hotel Monaco.  It's a short walk to most of the tourist sites, fun eating establishments and the hotel personnel are very friendly and helpful with anything you may want to see or explore.  A special touch that made our stay the more welcoming was a goldfish in our room.  Someone to come home to in a way.
