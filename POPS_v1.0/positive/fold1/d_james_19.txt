"If you are in Chi-town you have to stay at the James!", my friends all said. Well, you know what? They were right. The James is THE place to stay in Chicago. From the moment you walk in the door you are surrounded by luxury. Not the kind of pretentious luxury you'll find at those other hotels but an honest, relaxed and enjoyable luxury that simply boasts of confidence. That confidence extends to everything and everyone who works there. It's just not their job to see that you are treated right but their pleasure. They actually are glad you are there. Other places have attitude but the James has authenticity. I was so overwhelmed by what I saw and experienced on my way to my room that actually opening the door to my room was anti-climatic. As I understand it different rooms at the James have different themes. My room was mid-century deluxe and it wasn't an afterthought! The furnishings were amazing from the chairs to the pictures on the walls it was as if I had never left home but home was never like this. Seamlessly blended into the mid-century funk was cutting edge technology: Plasma TV, CD/Radio, Projection alarm clock! In a word: amazing! There is so much to do and so many wonderful restaurants in Chicago I never did get to experience the food at the James but if what I overheard on the elevator is any indication I could have easily spent the entire trip inside the James and never tire of the food or the service. The minibar, the in-room menu and lobby barroom are beyond reproach! Did I mention the beds? I didn't? That's because mere words could not begin to describe the angel-soft mattress and the super-crisp linens that envelope you as soon as you lie down. I could have easily slept the whole trip away wrapped in the comfort of my bed there. I may go back just to spend a week sleeping at the James. In fact the James has so much to offer, I'm returning soon. You should, too!
