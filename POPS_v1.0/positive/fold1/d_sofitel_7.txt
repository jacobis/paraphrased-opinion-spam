Well, what can I say? Sofitel in downtown Chicago always gets it right! My wife and daughter initially selected this hotel for it's convenient location but because of such great experiences, we have been back several times. We are always pleased with the hotel staff and the hotel's modern conveniences. They serve affordable, delicious breakfast every morning and the staff cater to every whim. The hotel is decorated beautifully, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the view of the city is spectacular. My family and I enjoy how close shopping and dining are to the hotel and the concierge is always available to recommend new and exciting destinations. We will be back!
