Hotel Monoco is a really great place to stay. I really liked the service I received from the front desk and staff. The room was very spacious and had a lot of modern electronics. It is rare to find a hotel with flat screen TV's in the midwest. The bathroom was also very big and offered plenty of complimentary shampoo. The hotel is near a lot of fun attractions in Chicago like the Willis Tower (Sears) and Millennium Park. The room had an amazing view of the river. I would recommend booking a room at this hotel.
