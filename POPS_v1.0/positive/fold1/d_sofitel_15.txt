The Sofitel Water Tower Place in Chicago is in a perfect location, close to nightlife, shops, the beach, and many business meeting locations. The decor was modern and beautifully decorated for the winter season in which I visited. Rooms were quite comfortable, airy, and surprisingly quiet. The service and amenities were very enjoyable, with only a few personal hiccups due to clerical errors. We booked a special "chocolate lovers" package that included breakfast, dinner, a snack, and a gift. We did not receive a gift, however. We also are members of A-club favorite guest which did not deliver a gift like promised. Upon inquiry, we were told that the snack was the gift. Besides that, the dining experience was excellent with flawless service. I would go back just to eat there! If you don't want to spend the money for the package, though, you don't have to. There is a 24-hour restaurant just steps away, along with Starbucks, and many other convenient shops and restaurants that would more than serve your needs. The service at this hotel might be the best, the waiters didn't even write down our order, they memorized it all! The amenities were great, including a small functional gym, reasonably priced 24-hour Wi-Fi, super comfortable beds, and quiet and private alcoves and facilities. All of the hotel staff including the concierge and doormen were beyond professional and helpful. It is one of the best hotels to stay in in all of Chicago. I extremely enjoyed my stay and I look forward to booking a stay there again in the near future.
