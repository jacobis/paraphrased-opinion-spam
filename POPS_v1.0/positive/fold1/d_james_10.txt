When I first got to the hotel service was excellent. I was very pleased with our room. It was modern, and I slept great every night in soft bed. When I would stay at this hotel every time I came to Chicago. The location could not be better and there are some great restaurants to eat at when you get hungry. I'm trying to book another stay as soon as I can.
