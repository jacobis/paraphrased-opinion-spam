What a beautiful hotel and a wonderful place to stay. The service was exceptional, as were the added extras like morning coffee service, evening wine reception, and free snacks in the room. It's ideally situated near a bustling part of town, with lots of restaurants, theaters and others things to do within walking distance. The views are nice and the overall atmosphere's a true joy. I can't recommend this place highly enough! I have no doubt this will be my first choice for a hotel when I return to Chicago.
