This is a great hotel that you will not regret staying in. The whole experience was wonderful, from the amazing architectural views when you walk in, to the service throughout the stay. The rooms are great, with comfortable beds, nice linens, and amazing bathroom. Everything is very clean and well kept. The service staff is excellent, and the wi-fi is top-notch. The hotel is in a great spot, with many choices of activities just outside. Overall, one of the best stays I've ever had a hotel.
