This is a great hotel. The location is really nice, with things to do and places to go very nearby. The staff are amazingly courteous and helpful, and extremely good at their jobs, especially the concierge staff and the housekeeping staff. The rooms are designed well, being well lit and having plenty of space and being very modern. The bathrooms (something I consider very important) are well stocked and taken care of on a daily basis, making my experience that much better. And lastly, with a price point of around $220, this is quite a luxurious stay at a fair price!
