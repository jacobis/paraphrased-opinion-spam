I recently decided to take a trip to Chicago for a weekend getaway. We decided to stay at the Hilton for out time there. Upon arriving we were greeted with great staff. They were nice and curteous and even upgraded our room free of charge. A nice gesture considering the already cheap price of the room! The bedroom we got was great. Despite being a king size bed, the room gave us adequate room to move and get ready for our vacation. The location is supreme as well. You are within walking distance of many touristy attractions and you probably can get away without a taxi or driving anywhere while you stay at the Hilton. Room service was great as well. While the food may be a little on the high side, it was the price you pay for a quality meal while you eat in bed relaxing after a long day. After we got back every day, the rooms were spotless. I cannot tell you how many times I've come back to a dirty room and need room service to come through a second time. The Hilton was a fantastic choice.
