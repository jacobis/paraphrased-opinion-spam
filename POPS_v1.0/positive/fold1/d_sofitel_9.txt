If you're visiting Chicago, I highly recommend staying at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. It's like staying in a luxury hotel for a very reasonable price. Request a room on one of the higher up floors for a fantastic view of the city. The service we received was consistently excellent. The concierge was helpful and we received room service promptly. Even the portions of food that come with the room service were very generous and worth the price. The room itself was very nice with a nice HD TV and a bed that was like sleeping on a cloud.
