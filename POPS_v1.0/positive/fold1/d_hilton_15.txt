We just got back from an extravagant stay at the Hilton Towers in Chicago.  We had a nice, and extremely comfortable queen sized bed in our single room.  I knew this place was going to be amazing right when I entered the door.  The beautiful decorations all around the lobby screamed luxury.  Also, the service was amazing!  We got a room picked out for us in a matter of minutes thanks to the help from a friendly worker.  Afterwards, we hit the restaurant there that had a nice and homely Irish theme.  Folk music that soothes the soul could be heard from the restaurant every time we passed by.  Not to mention, the restaurant had a delicious Shepherd's pie.  I would kill to be able to make it myself.  Overall, I give the hotel a 5 star review and would be glad to go back next time I travel to Chicago.
