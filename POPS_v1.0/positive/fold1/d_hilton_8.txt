When we recently came to visit Chicago we decided to stay here based on previous reviews of guests.  I am very glad we booked at this hotel.  The hotel itself is a great size and the individual rooms were also fantastic.  Rooms were extremely clean and our room specifically was very large and comfy. The staff at the hotel was awesome.  Super helpful!  whenever we needed anything the concierge was more than willing to help.  We utilized the room service more than once and the food was great and the food came very quickly. Hotel was in a prime area, very close to the Art Museum as well as various parks. Tons of restaurants and cafes near by in case you want to eat while sightseeing. Will definitely stay there again
