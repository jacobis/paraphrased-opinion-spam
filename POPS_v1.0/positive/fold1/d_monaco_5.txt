From what I have read and experienced through the writings of others that have stayed at this hotel is that it seems to be an extremely fantastic stay. The concierge and the staff seem very pleasant and willing to assist you in whatever it is you might need. The hotel itself as well and most importantly the bed rooms seem beautiful when spoken of and very well furnished with anything you might need. The food in the restaurant seems tasteful and up to standards of most guests and I would not mind dining here myself. The views from the bedrooms also seem gorgeous and vibrant.
