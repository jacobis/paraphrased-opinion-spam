The Hotel Monaco is a fantastic hotel with a great location. The hotel is located right on the river and offers some spectacular views while also being located within walking distance to Millennium park, Sears tower, Greek town, and Lincoln park. The list doesn't stop there of all the features that this hotel offers guests. They offer warm cookies in the afternoon as well as complimentary wine tours that occur daily. The rooms are very spacious and offer flat TV's , traditional seating, and large bathrooms. The fabric headboards are a nice style touch and an unexpected pleasant detail. As if those offerings weren't enough, the Hotel Monaco has a fantastic staff that offer the ultimate customer experience to their guests. There was a temporary issue with our reservation that was booked through a third party but the staff were able to handle the problem and gave us a free room upgrade!! The hotel was a nice experience and I look forward to going again.
