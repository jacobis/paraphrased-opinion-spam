My stay at The James was simply incredible. The room rates were extremely low, so I decided to upgrade the room to a suite. When I got there, the staff were welcoming and helpful in getting me to my room and settled in. The room was modern and stylish and I loved all the decor and swank amenities in the bathroom! I felt like a queen. When I opened the curtains to see the view, I was taken aback by the beauty of the city view. I'm so glad that I decided to stay here.
