First time in Chicago.  Our room was on the 6th floor. Staff was helpful & friendly, room was huge with fantastic view of the river. Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in August and loved the hotel. I could walk to all the places I wanted to see  I would definitely recommend this hotel . Love the goldfish
