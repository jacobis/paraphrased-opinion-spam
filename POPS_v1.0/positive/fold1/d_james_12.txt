This hotel was amazing!! It had a trendy feel, without the pricetag you would assume for such a top-notch hotel. The rooms were extremely comfortable and the amenities and service in the hotel were awesome. I am a seasoned traveler and visit Chicago several times a year ,and can honestly say that this hotel is my new go-to spot, not only because of the amazing quality, but also because of the great prices.
