The location of the Sofitel can't be beat. It's in walking distance of popular streets with shops and restaurants and is super convenient. You can seriously do everything on foot from breakfast and coffee to the incredible nightlife just steps away. The hotel itself is beautiful; the decor in the lobby and rooms is modern and chic and the rooms themselves are spacious yet cozy. And the beds are phenomenally comfortable. There are some amenities worth noting: a clean and well-equipped gym, a Concierge service, and wifi in the rooms (you have to pay for it, but it's super reasonable. The staff here is incredibly welcoming and friendly and though I was staying here for business I'd definitely be back with my spouse or family. Just really great all around.
