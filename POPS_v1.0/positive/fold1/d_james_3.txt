This hotel is amazing! First, the TV in the room is huge. It's almost like a mini-theater! They even offer a "Virtual Tuck-In Service" which allows you to say goodnight to your children via webcam. The room also includes an iPod dock/stereo with a complimentary CD. Free Wi-Fi as well. State of the art electronics here. This hotel offers everything; they have a spa, gym, amazing restaurant, business center, and a very chill bar/lounge. The bartender is definitely quality and knows what he is doing, and the restaurant is rated very highly. The concierge service is top notch and are extremely willing to help with anything and everything. They truly make you feel welcome, and you may never want to actually leave! It is pet-friendly, and they even give treats to your pets. It is located very centrally to everything, and you probably won't even need a cab. Great restaurants, hair salons, and attractions are very close. You won't regret staying here.
