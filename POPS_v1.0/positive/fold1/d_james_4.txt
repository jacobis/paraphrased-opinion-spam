The James is one of the top rated hotels in the downtown Chicago area and I can see why. Our expectations were pretty high and our experience was better than our expectations. We found our room well appointed with state of the art electronics (better than we enjoy at home, as a matter of fact). Though complimentary wi-fi is pretty much a standard feature in most hotels, the wi-fi at the James is fast, unlike connections you find at many other hotels. Though I have difficulty most of the time sleeping in an unfamiliar bed in an unfamiliar place, this was definitely NOT my experience at the James. I found the bed to be, to paraphrase Goldielocks, "..just right," and I enjoyed deep, relaxing sleep throughout our stay there. Speaking of our stay - I mentioned our room was well appointed, and it definitely was but moreover, I didn't get the feeling of bland anonymity when I entered our room.  The furnishings were pristine but moreover, the decor was gracious and well done and somehow gave me a feeling of coming home; I didn't feel like an itinerant traveler, didn't feel like a cog in a machine - I felt like the room was MINE, and I believe it had to do with certain touches in the decor; an accent pillow with personality, interesting prints on the wall that you'd find in a home rather than a hotel.  It was warm and inviting from the get-go. One last thing: We had two occasions during our stay to dine at the hotel restaurant, something we would normally avoid, as I get the feeling too many hotel restaurants know they don't have to shoot for excellence, as they can count on a certain percentage of "captive audience," so to speak, with hotel guests dining there simply as default.  We took the chance after having read a few online reviews and we were elated that we did! The food was excellent, the menu varied and the service was outstanding. All in all, I feel we made an excellent choice in staying at the James, and I would not hesitate to book another visit.
