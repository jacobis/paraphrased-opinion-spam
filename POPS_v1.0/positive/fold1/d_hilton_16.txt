Had an absolutely fantastic time at the Hilton Towers Chicago.  The location is ideal for a weekend getaway to Chicago the shops on Michigan Ave. are an easy walk from the hotel, which is opposite a very nice park; walking to the Art Museum and, a must see, Buddy Guys Blues Club, is also easily done from this location.  It's easy to catch a cab if you want to go somewhere out of walking distance, such as the Museum of Science and Industry, which cost about $15 each way.  If you want to stay put, Kitty the bar and restaurant located in the hotel is absolutely delightful.  It's a traditional Irish Pub and Eatery, offering great beers, Shepard's Pie, crisps, and of course live music.  The hotel itself is lavish, offering an older styling full of glamour and glitz.  The size of the rooms are amazing some even offer two bathrooms to make getting ready with whomever you are traveling a breeze.  The amenities make your stay relaxing plenty of coffee, an excellent breakfast service, and personal items await you from Crabtree & Evelyn.  This hotel has changed over the years, and it keeps getting better but retaining it's historic appeal.  Highly recommended!
