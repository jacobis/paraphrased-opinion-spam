At first, the idea of staying at the Sofitel Water Tower Place was a bit off putting, but at the end it was worth going through all the trouble. The price seemed a tad far fetched, but it exceeded all expectations. The staff went above and beyond to make sure that the customers were as comfortable as possible, with the least amount of disturbance. The bedrooms were significantly large, and smelled fragrant. Access for the internet was provided on demand, and shopping centers were a 2 minute walk away from the hotel. The hotel, located next to a 24 hour diner, provided breakfast and dinner which were carefully prepared according to the package that was selected before signing in. The fitness center was beyond par, and was well equipped. The whole experience makes one want to go back to Chicago and spend more time at the hotel.
