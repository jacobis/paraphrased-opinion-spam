Hotel Monaco was a perfectly located hotel, which was minutes from walking to the museums, shops, and a park, and had a nice view of the river. The rooms are larger than standard rooms with access to free internet. There was also free coffee, tea, and even happy hour! The staff was very friendly and informative. For example, the concierge was able to get us last minute reservations at a restaurant and detail information and services for our cruise. Overall, the hotel, service, and amenities were worth it at such a great rate. I would definitely recommend it and stay here again!
