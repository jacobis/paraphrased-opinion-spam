I recently traveled to Chicago for business and personal reasons. I decided to stay at Hilton. Overall, I could not have been more satisfied with their service. Seriously, from top to bottom, everything was absolutely awesome. The room was ready upon arrival and was ver clean and tidy. The hotel was quite busy since there were some conventions going on, but the concierge was extremely nice, helpful, and forthcoming about services and ways to get around the high-volume atmosphere. The location of the hotel is perfect. My wife and I ate breakfast at a gorgeous nearby cafe named "Orange" that had fantastic food and reliable service. On our first personal day, we approached the concierge and they were able to secure tickets to see Wicked for the same day. I was very impressed with how accommodating and driven the concierge staff was. Because of the location to common attractions, services provided, and cleanliness of the hotel, I would highly recommend the Hilton to anyone venturing to Chicago.
