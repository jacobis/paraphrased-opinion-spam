My family just stayed at this hotel for three nights. When we arrived, we were greeted with friendly and knowledgeable staff who quickly got us to our room. The room was very clean and quite large. We had plenty of room to spread out. The beds were so comfy and the linens were very soft. We found a great deal online so the room was very affordable. What we loved most was the view!
