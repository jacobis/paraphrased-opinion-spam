This hotel overall was great, a great learning experience. If it wasn't for the lady at the front desk working so hard to insure we were comfortable I would not have been as pleased as I was. She did a great job! This hotel was very pet friendly and had great decor and service. The room was nice! A studio that was decent sized and had two tvs, pretty good condition and the furniture was cool! The bathroom was average the only problem was that the water did not get very hot, but that I can deal with for the price. As far as electronics we had a mini bar with a mini fridge and microwave, and 2 pretty decent sized tavs that were flat screen. There was free wifi, great room service menu, even options for the dog! They had a big water bowl and doggy treats at the entrance for pets too. Great experience, neat hotel, I would definitely visit again and recommend this place.
