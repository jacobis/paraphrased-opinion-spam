We recently stayed at the Hilton in Chicago and boy are we glad we did.  Upon entering the hotel you are met by the attentive and courteous staff.  We were brought to our Tower Room on one of the upper floors.  The views of Lake Michigan from the upper floors are breathtaking.  The room itself was great.  The room  had a bar and a small tv.  Most importantly, it was immaculately clean and the had a large, comfy bed.  In addition to the fabulous staff and room, the Hilton has a great breakfast buffet.  Not only is the food delicious, it's also fairly priced.   Overall, I feel very happy about our stay at the Hilton and would gladly stay there again.
