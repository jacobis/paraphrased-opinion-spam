Talk about a pleasant surprise! This is on my list of top places to stay.  Was in Chicago on both a business and pleasure trip. The location of the Sofitel fit perfect for both! Starting with the gorgeous view of the Golden Mile, it was walking distance to everything I needed - Starbucks, spa, hairdressers and oh did I mention - shopping! The room really was topshelf! A luxurious finely appointed bathroom and the bed, linens and pillows came together to provide me my best night's sleep ever in a hotel. A fine LCD TV and Bose Wave Machine were those little things one would expect in a fine hotel like this. The service was really outstanding, yet I would mention the valet parking is very pricey at $40 per day - but expect that in downtown Chicago. Overall one of my best and most memorable stays ever, wonderful European style amenities made the extra $$ worth every penny
