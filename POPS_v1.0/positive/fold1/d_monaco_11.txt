We 100% recommend staying at this hotel. The staff was more than pleasant and helpful. For example going above and beyond and printing our boarding tickets to our flight. The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to a lot of entertainment and restaurant choices. The hotel has a restaurant and bar, both are not the best part of the hotel but its definitely not a deal breaker. The hotel has a bright modern feel and the rooms were very comfortable. There are no bad rooms in this hotel. We have stayed in this hotel before. All rooms whether at the far end by the stairs or the rooms in front of the elevator are quiet. This is definitely the hotel I would check into every time we are in the area. For my family this is the only hotel for us. 5 stars
