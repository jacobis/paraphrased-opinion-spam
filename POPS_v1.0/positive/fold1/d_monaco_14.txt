Looking for a great place to stay in Chicago? The Monaco is a hotel I highly recommend. My favorite part about being a guest there is the window seats that overlook the city. I could sit there for hours watching the city life. The hotel is close to all the main attractions which allows me to take time for relaxing at the window seat. The staff at the Monaco are fantastic! I had a great experience with everyone at Monaco, both guest and staff. There are social events, such as a wine hour for guests, that make it easy to meet new people and talk about things to see and do in Chicago. The hotel is kid friendly and the staff will help with any special requests. Would recommend to family and friends.
