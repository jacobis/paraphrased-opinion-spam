What can I say it is the Hilton. From the moment we walked in you could tell service was going to excellent, and thank goodness our trip had an unexpected lay over. The positive attitude from the check in desk to the night cap we ordered in the bar was what we needed to kick off our vacation. This was the first time we stayed in a Hilton and my wife found a little discount online, but no matter what the price was work it and comparable to a lesser hotel I am sure. Really enjoyed the advice from the bartender for the sweet breakfast spot down the street, the best eggs benedict and smoked salmon I have ever had! Over all this might be my hotel of choice in the future.
