The Palmer House is a beautifully, newly-restored hotel that is over 130 years old. It's got gorgeous views inside of the formal decorations of the house which was built for its time. It's in the heart of Chicago, within walking distance of Millennium Park and the Art Institute. The price of the Palmer House isn't too outrageous, between $150-$200 a night. The staff is very friendly and even though the hotel is historical, it has all up to date amenities like TV and internet. The only thing missing is a coffee maker in the room. The bedding is very comfortable with sufficient pillows for you to get an excellent night's sleep.
