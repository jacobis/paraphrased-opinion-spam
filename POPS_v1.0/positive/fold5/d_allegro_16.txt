We have stayed here several times and you can't beat the location. At our last stay, we parked our car and didn't touch it again until we checked out, it's right by the L and many great bar and restaurant locations. They were very welcoming to our Chocolate lab, Molly, too! The hotel is beautifully renovated. My only complaint is that the rooms were a little small, but we barely spent any time there, anyway. Wonderful experience with a very helpful staff. Would stay there again!
