The Allegro has great service. The concierge and service staff are great! I really liked how environmentally conscious the hotel is with the products they provide. This hotel is pet friendly which is such a rarity these days. The rooms are very nice, and the beds are really comfortable. The room service was delicious, and the kitchen even checked to make sure everything was to my liking!
