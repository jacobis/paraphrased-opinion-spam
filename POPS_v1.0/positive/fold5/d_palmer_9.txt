Booked this hotel for a trip with my family. The price was an awesome deal ($80 a night), especially with all the access to the surrounding attractions, such as the Navy Pier, museums, the Sears Tower,  sight seeings, and much more. The hotel was very accommodating from the easy valet parking to the size of our 2 double bed room. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone considering staying. Can't beat the deal and amenities!
