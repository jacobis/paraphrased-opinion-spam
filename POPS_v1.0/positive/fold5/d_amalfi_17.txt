Don't let the appearance of a smaller building nestled between the monstrous skyscrapers of the downtown Chicago sway you from checking out the Amalfi Hotel; the decor inside the building is strikingly beautiful, it has a very modern feel to it.  As you check in, you will be treated to some of the best customer service that I have ever experienced -  this was a very welcome constant throughout our stay here.  The staff is very friendly, and they are willing to go out of their way to make sure that your stay is a great one.  The rooms continue on with the modern feel, they include all the amenities that you would come to expect from a top notch hotel, including wifi and a business center.  The rooms are exceptionally clean and comfortable, the beds are great!  Throughout your stay, you will be treated to some fantastic food as a continental breakfast is provided each morning - I loved being able to take everything back to my room and eat in peace, rather than having to fight with the crowds.  I also loved the location of the hotel, being close to downtown and being able to get to everything quite easily.  I'm not great at getting around in big cities, but being close to some really great shops and restaurants, as well as being so close to the "L" really allowed me to explore the downtown area comfortably.  Next time I'm in Chicago, I can't wait to stay at the Amalfi again.
