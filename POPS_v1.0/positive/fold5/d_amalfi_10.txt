The Amalfi hotel in Chicago is a wonderful hotel. It is close by many great locations to shop and dine out. There is a great atmosphere around the hotel and it is a very inexpensive ride by train to the hotel. The amenities are fantastic and the staff is wonderful! All the food I ate at the Amalfi was top notch. Even though there are great restaurants very close by, I would recommend just eating at the hotel because it's such a great environment and the food is fantastic. I loved the rooms, very spacious and lovely. There were great bath products (TOP OF THE LINE!) and the staff even left me champagne. I was thoroughly impressed by the entire stay and would recommend it highly to my friends and family.
