I recently stayed at the Intercontinental and was extremely pleased with my experience there. The hotel is in a fabulous location, right on Chicago's famed Magnificent Mile. It's also a quick walk to nearby restaurants, bars and convention centers-you don't have to venture far out the front door to find what you're looking for here! The rooms were beautiful, and the staff were consistently friendly and helpful whenever I had questions or needed anything. The indoor pool is lovely, and the Starbucks in the lobby is also a nice, convenient addition. I would highly recommend that anyone traveling through Chicago stay at the Intercontinental!
