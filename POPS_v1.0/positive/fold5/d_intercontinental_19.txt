Stayed at the InterContinental recently and will absolutely stay again the next time I'm in Chicago.  The hotel is located on Michigan Avenue (the Magnificent Mile) which is an extremely convenient location.  Public Transportation is available or most places are well within walking distance.  Although, I valeted my car for only $42 dollars a day.  Customer service was impeccable. I had a great night's sleep in a comfortable king-sized bed and my room was clean, modern, and had everything I needed.   Wi-fi only cost $10 a day and I never had a weak connection. The in-house restaurant called Zest is Zagat rated and perfect for when I wanted to not venture out.  There is a great fitness club that you only pay $16.00 for your whole stay.  I used it every day...well worth the small charge.  Using Priceline, I got my room for an awesome deal of $75.00 a night.  Overall, I had a great stay at InterContinental and I highly recommend it!
