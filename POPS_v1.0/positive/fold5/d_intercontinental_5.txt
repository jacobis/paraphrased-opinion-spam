For a price of $53.00, it is not always worth it to think about a high class stay at a hotel - but our visit to the Intercontinental was a wonderful mix of luxury and relaxation that will last us for a long time. The evening started off with an upgrade in the room, a room which was so spacious - it was wonderful. Another wonderful tibit of this trip is the fact that the location was really ideal. Where many hotels in this price range may be a little bit sketchy, but this one definitely was not. The bonus effect of the great location is that this hotel can beat bigger shot hotels that may be in worse areas. Lastly, there are a number of accessory items to the trip that are of no hassle - one, being parking. Though there is a lot of cars at this hotel, but there is valet service that makes moving around very easy and able to accommod.ate all types of people. For those who like to wind down, I would also suggest checking out the hotel bar which has some great drinks.
