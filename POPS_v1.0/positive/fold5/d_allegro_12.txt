I visited the Allegro when I was in town for work, and despite what other guests have said, had an overall pleasant experience. The hotel is close to many different places of interests, and even if you're not one for walking (I am), they're an inexpensive car ride away. The room itself was surprisingly spacious, and while the decor is a bit loud, not distracting in the least. To be honest, I found it fun and charming. I was concerned with the possibility of a noisy stay as I'm a light sleeper, but heard nothing from adjoining rooms, even though the hotel was completely booked! I ordered in room service after an especially busy day, and the food was affordable, fast, and tasty. All of my encounters with Allegro staff were friendly, and they went above and beyond to make my visit great. Highly recommend!
