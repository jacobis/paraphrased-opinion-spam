The intercontinental hotel is a perfect hotel for a couple night stay. This hotel has one of the best locations in Chicago and is a great, tall hotel right on the magnificent mile.  It is a perfect location to get to everything in Chicago.  The rooms are terrific, the suite are very nice rooms.  They are perfectly finished with coffee tables in the suite and finished in art deco.  The bathrooms are the perfect size and very clean.  It has a separate shower, so plenty of room within the bathroom.  The price is pretty good for special occasions however a little disappointed on the extra charges for wifi (9.95/day), anymore I expect that to be included.  Parking is almost $50 so I wouldn't recommended it especially in Chicago.  Overall, it is a great hotel in a great location in downtown Chicago.
