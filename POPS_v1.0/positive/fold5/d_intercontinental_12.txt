I chose this hotel because of its superb location and I was not disappointed on that. However the rooms were on the smaller side, but they made up for that with a nice LCD tv. The hotel restaurant is a tad over priced but the food at the buffet is good. The hotel staff were get an very attentive. Overall I would stay here again.
