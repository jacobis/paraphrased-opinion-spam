This hotel has a great Ambassador rewards program with members seeing great upgrades.  The rooms are reasonably priced with specials for the holidays!  Expect the little things like a fruit basket or chocolate covered strawberries waiting for you when you reach your room.  The staff and service are great; very accommodating and will go the extra mile to make you feel welcome!  The rooms are all well decorated and spacious, with nice linens and bathrooms!  The in-house restaurant offers good fare, and the bar won't break the bank!  A very good hotel, don't stay just one night!
