We were pleased when we arrived and realized we were within walking distance of everything, but chose to stay in and have dinner and drinks at the bar on our first evening.  I can't say enough about the comfy bedding at this hotel, it was heavenly after a long drive.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the overpriced parking fees.
