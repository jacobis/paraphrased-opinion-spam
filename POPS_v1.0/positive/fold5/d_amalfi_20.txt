This hotel was exactly what I was looking for - perfect location just down the street from the "L" train, with a friendly and attentive staff that was helpful throughout my stay.  The room was classic and inviting yet modern, looked like it had been recently renovated.  The bathroom also came with modern fixtures and even Aveda products, which was a nice touch.  Best of all, the continental breakfast had delicious pastries and fruit, just what I needed before heading out to my day's meetings.  Would definitely recommend!
