Overall, I had a very pleasant stay at the hotel. The service was fantastic as I entered the hotel, and they made it very easy to check in and get all of my bags to my room. The room was very tidy when I entered, and it was just the right size. The bathrooms were a little small, but they were large enough and stocked with all of the necessary items. Me and my family had a great night of sleep, with little to no noise heard through the walls, and we woke up to find that it was very easy to find stuff to do near the hotel.
