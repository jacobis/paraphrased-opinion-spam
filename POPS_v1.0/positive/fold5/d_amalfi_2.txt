OMG the Amalfi hotel is a fabulous hidden gem in downtown Chicago.  I live in the suburbs and some of my girlfriends and I decided to take a "staycation" at a hotel near Magnificent Mile (shopping!!!).  The Amalfi managed to both be right in the middle of all the attractions we planned to visit AND one of the better hotel deals in that area.  The price of our rooms was low enough that we were all thrilled to have a bit of extra money for the boutiques.  Or an extra bottle of wine delivered to our room when we decided we were too tired to walk back out to a restaurant.  ;)  We stayed just for the weekend, but I wish it could have been longer.  Our rooms were all next to each other on the quieter side of the building (be sure to request that if you're a light sleeper), and it was soooo hard to leave on the last day.  I shared a room with one girlfriend, and it was fabulously large and luxurious.  We didn't want to leave on the last day - our feet were worn out and the beds were SO comfortable. Thank you Amalfi and staff - you helped make this the best staycation EVER!!!  <3
