Really enjoyed my stay in downtown Chicago's Allegro hotel, which is actually a Kimpton resort property. Newly remodeled, with small, yet comfortable rooms, I found the location convenient to shops and nightlife and the prices seemed reasonable for the quality of the hotel. The staff was friendly and the service was great. True to the Kimpton tradition, they were happy to welcome both my dog and myself and even had a dog bed in the room for her when we got to the room after checking in. One of the highlights of my stay was the winebar and social hour where I really got to relax and meet some of the other guests. Overall a great experience and I can't wait to stay at the Allegro again when I'm back in Chicago!
