This hotel is a very easy to navigate hotel, because of it's small stature. A very petite bathroom, but roomy enough for the home away form home feeling. With their friendly staff, my family and I enjoyed our time away from home with nothing but positive feelings during our stay. Though many other guests were at the hotel, at night time when it counted the most, our room remained quiet while holding many younger teens at the hotel. We were close to all of the major attractions that the city had to offer. I feel that put the icing on the cake for our stay here.
