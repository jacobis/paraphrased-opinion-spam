At $130 a night, our king suite at the Allegro was certainly a bargain! Although it's not a 5-star hotel, it's still a great stay for the price. I've heard people say the "normal" rooms are quite small, but that wasn't our experience in our suite - it was huge; with a living room, bathroom, bedroom area, and even two closets! It was very clean and seemed to have been recently renovated. The whole atmosphere of our room and the hotel was very pleasing - we had friendly staff, morning coffee and evening wine, and even had classical music playing upon entering the suite. The hotel itself is also conveniently located near several other amenities - food and even tourist destinations were just right down the block, and public transport was easily accessible. I do have a few complaints, however. The bar and restaurant seemed to be operating independently of the posted schedule, and our room didn't include a safe as advertised. Most of the shops in the area were also closed by 6pm! Overall though, I have to say that the Allegro provided an excellent experience for the price. I'd book again in the future without hesitation!
