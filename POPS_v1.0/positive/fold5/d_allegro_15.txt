The Allegro offers it all in a great boutique-style hotel experience in the heart of downtown Chicago, this place is clean and comfortable, with stylish flair in the cozy retro modern rooms & the slinky lounge for cocktails. Friendly staff make for a great stay, and lots of restaurants and shopping is accessible within walking distance.  It's also pet-friendly, so what more could you ask for? Will definitely visit again when we get the chance!
