Just got back from a two-night getaway at the Amalfi.  Our room was clean and pleasantly redecorated as were the lobby and other common areas.  The staff was super-friendly and helpful and told out about some great local restaurants to try.  It was nice to be able to park at the hotel and walk to many of the sights we wanted to see.  The special rate for our mid-week stay was a definite plus, as were the complimentary and convenient continental breakfasts and evening reception with cocktails and appetizers.  We will be back!
