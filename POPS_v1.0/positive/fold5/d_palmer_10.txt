Good location, pool kept my kids busy and gave us a place to take a rest after a day of touring around the city. The closet was huge which really helped us fit all the luggage we brought along, plus the camping gear. Valet parking was a breeze of fresh air from the beginning, after being on a 5 hour flight all I wanted was for this trip to be a vacation, and that's exactly what it was. The staff and the general appearance of the hotel, was well worth the money. The area around the hotel was pretty good, being walking distance from Sears Tower and some restaurants gave us something to do the first night we got in. But would also be good if you had a free vacation day to spare. We had a great time staying , and know for sure where we would stay the next time we pass through.
