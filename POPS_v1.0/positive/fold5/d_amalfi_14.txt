Arriving at the hotel, I was greeted by the friendly staff. Such great service was consistent throughout our stay from the time we checked in until we checked out. The room was decked out with comfortable beds, and we had a pretty spacious bathroom. Our room was also next to the gym. No need to forego fitness on this trip! We also received a complimentary happy hour with free drinks and wonderful snacks. The location was great. We didn't have to take a cab anywhere, since we were within walking distance of all the hot spots.
