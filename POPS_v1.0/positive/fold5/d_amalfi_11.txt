This hotel is amazing first off because of its location to many restaurants including the ever-popular House of Blues. I was able to walk to anything I needed and wanted to see, which is extremely convenient. While the location was great, I was also impressed with the room and its amenities. The bathroom was stocked with high-quality products, and the room was clean and comfortable. Complimentary coffee and pastries were available on every floor. The staff was always pleasant and helpful.
