We usually stay here every December because we believe it has been the best place we've stayed there. The rooms were comfortable for two people. The hotel room and the exterior were very modern and elegant with amenities such as continental breakfast, a restaurant inside the hotel, and cocktail hour. Everything is upgraded and up to date! I once booked a room for 3 nights for a girls weekend and of course, they didn't let me down with their service and it was very close to all the Chicago attractions. Another time we went, we stayed here for 5 nights and everything was great and clean. Excellent service and close to all the tourist attractions we wanted to see and they let us check in early which was a bonus!
