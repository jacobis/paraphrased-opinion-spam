Just returned from a 3 day visit at the Palmer House in Chicago and it was absolutely amazing.  Big, beautifully decorated comfortable beds, friendly, caring staff, private bathrooms even when you share a room!  It is also within walking distance of the Art Instutute and Millenium Park.  Would recommend to anyone who needs a nice place to stay for a day or two.
