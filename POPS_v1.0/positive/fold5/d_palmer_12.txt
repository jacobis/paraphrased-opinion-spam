The hotel was exactly what we were looking for in terms of our family. Everything we wanted to see was nearby, and we were able to visit a lot of tourist attractions. The service was also a great unexpected touch, as the staff did everything they could to make us feel at home. The rooms were excellent, although we did wish that the bathrooms were a touch bigger, as it was too small to fit our family comfortably. Other than this, we were completely satisfied with our decision to stay at this hotel
