This hotel is a very pleasant surprise.  Although modestly priced, it offers a wonderful, relaxing and indulgent hotel experience.  The location of the hotel is great-central to many local attractions.  The rooms are large and exceptionally comfortable.   Even the most modest rooms are comfortable-all renovated within the past five years.  Valet parking is an additional expense, but at the regular rates, the hotel is worth it.  Room service is quick and easy, although the food was average.  You might do well to eat at one of the many places nearby.  That aside, this hotel is well worth the price.
