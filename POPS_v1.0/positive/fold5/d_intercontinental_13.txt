What a great Chicago hotel! I booked this hotel at a great price for a week long stay and was so happy with my choice. The hotel has a great location right on the Magnificent Mile, giving us many nearby dining and shopping options. The pool is amazing, and our rooms were clean and spacious. The overall feel of the hotel was one of elegance. The best part was the staff. The concierge was helpful, and all the employees were very friendly. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Chicago.
