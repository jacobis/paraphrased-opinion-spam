I stayed in a very spacious room that had was in a perfect location with an amazing view.  The concierges did a great job with fulfilling my needs and helped me with no difficulty.  You could argue that the hotel was better than many other big name hotels.  Even the little things such as bed and bar quality were top notch.  Great hotel and I would recommend it to a friend!
