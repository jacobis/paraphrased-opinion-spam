If you're looking for luxary stay in Chicago's Loop, the Allegro Hotel offers top rate rooms and servies. We enjoyed the comforts of a suite room with jacuzzi tub, complementary wine, and soft bedding. The hotel service is wonderful, and seemingly catering to modern hotel demand trends; we had iPod hookups and a recycling bin in our room, Aveda products in the bathroom, and they're even pet friendly! The Allegro is well worth the extra money from some other nearby hotels, and we strongly recommend! Great stay!
