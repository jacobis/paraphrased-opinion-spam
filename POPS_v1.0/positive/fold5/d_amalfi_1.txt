I was looking for a hotel in the central part of Chicago for a trip that combined business and pleasure -- some work meeting downtown, but also a chance to enjoy a real city. When I checked out the Amalfi, I found it had the perfect location  -- close to downtown for my meeting, walking distance to the Miracle Mile for shopping, the River, everything.  I was able to get a great deal online, so went for it.  Not disappointed.  My room was spacious and had extras, like free internet and Aveda bath products. A major bonus was the free happy hour, just the ticket for transitioning from work to pleasure!  Some reviewers here have complained about noise.  I could see that there is construction next door, but I was gone during Friday workday and no activity on the weekend, so no problem.  Will definitely visit the Amalfi again.
