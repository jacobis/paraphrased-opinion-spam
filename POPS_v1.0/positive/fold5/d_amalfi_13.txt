This hotel is located in the heart of Chicago, with plenty of nearby restaurants, bars, and attractions. They offer complimentary breakfast on each floor and free drinks every night from 5:30-7. The bedding was very comfortable and the room was clean and modern. I really enjoyed my stay and the friendliness of the hotel staff. I would definitely stay here again.
