The Allegro Hotel is located in a converted theatre in Chicago very close to the Loop and all the attractions it provides. It is an especially good place for theatre goers to stay and a short cab ride away from North Michigan Avenue and River North. Some of the rooms are more spacious than others, but all have been recently renovated. There is a nice restaurant and a wine bar in the lobby. The lobby also has comfortable sofas and chaise lounges. The rooms are moderately priced and the Klimpton Group sometimes offers special deals for those who sign up for their email mailing list.
