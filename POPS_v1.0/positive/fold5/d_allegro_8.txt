We stayed in the hotel over this past weekend. We spent 3 nights and the location was amazing. My girlfriend and I were able to take public transit to any of the surrounding sites around town. The room was very sizable but a good bang for the buck. It had a large queen bed, closets, clean bathrooms and desks and a safe! The staff was very friendly and we even have evening wine receptions. This hotel is a must stay!
