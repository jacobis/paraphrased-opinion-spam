The Palmer is the only hotel to use when going to Chicago. The staff is friendly and courteous and even takes those that are traveling with their pets. They are also very nice to the pets and their owners. They are only two blocks from the train station. They have their own restaurant and the food is simply delicious. It is not far from the midway and the valets will get your car for you very quickly. The comforters are very nice, and the towels are plush with the matching robes in the King size bed room. The queen size is very comfortable and all rooms get a continental breakfast. The interior is beautiful, it was redone to look like it was when it was built.
