Amalfi hotel is the place to be in case you ever need a place to stay in Chicago. The hotel offers a variety of services and amenities to fit your every need. The spacious rooms provide a homely feeling that could be enjoyed in addition to other facilities which are strategically located for convenience.   Breakfast is on every floor at no addition charge, and happy hour runs everyday from 5.30 to 7.00, comprising of reputable drinks, cheeses, meats, breads and peppers. The service was also impeccable from check in to check out. In addition, the hotel's location allows for easy access to the rest of the city. Guests could choose to walk, park, and visit other places without spending a lot of money. I definitely recommend this hotel to everybody looking for a nice quiet hotel that provides excellent rooms, beds, services, and compliments at no additional costs.
