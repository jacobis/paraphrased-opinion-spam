We found a great deal for this hotel online at a reasonable price.  It's located in the heart of downtown Chicago.  There is lots to see and do nearby, many restaurants, shops and museums.  The rooms were clean and you can tell they were recently renovated.  Don't expect a great view of the city, the hotel is designed in a strange manner.  We were happy with the service, the check-in was painless and they were always happy to help.  Next time we are back in the city, we will try to stay here again!  Great hotel for a great price.
