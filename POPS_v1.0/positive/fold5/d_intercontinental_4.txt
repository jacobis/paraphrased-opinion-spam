Our Saturday night stay was the BEST money we ever spent at any hotel. The hotel is right on the Magnificent Mile, nice room, great linens, clean bathroom, and very quiet. The suite was beautifully furnished and had an appealing theme. The concierge was very helpful and even helped arrange our dinner plans. I will definitely stay here on my next visit!
