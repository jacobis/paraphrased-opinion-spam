My family and I were on vacation for the week, and we stayed at the Amalfi Hotel. The rooms were a steal, and the staff were so wonderful to us when we arrived! The breakfast they served us was phenomenal and it was really peaceful and quiet waking up. The free internet and gym access was also a big plus. The location that this hotel is also really convenient, and my family and I were able to navigate easily throughout our trip.
