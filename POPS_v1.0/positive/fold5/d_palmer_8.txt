As part of our month long road trip, my boyfriend and I wanted to do some sightseeing in Chicago. We spent a night at the Palmer House, since it was only a short walking distance from the Art Institute and Millenium Park. Considering its location and beautiful ambience, I'd have to say the price of the hotel was very reasonable. Our room was clean & cozy, and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful...they actually seemed to enjoy their jobs. I wish we could have stayed for a few days, but we will definitely return soon! I highly recommend staying at the Palmer House, if you're ever in the Downtown Chicago area.
