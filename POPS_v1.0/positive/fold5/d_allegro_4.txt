"Home Sweet Home"  is truly the motto of the Kimpton properties.  When I traveled to Chicago in the dead of winter I was nothing short of pleasantly surprised with the warm welcoming as I stepped through the doors.  My room was inviting and cozy making me forget all about the cold weather outside.  My soak in the quaint bathtub was so relaxing.   When the storm hit I was relieved to be able to conduct business with the in room wi-fi making my trip a success.   The staff was friendly and the service so reliable.  The Allegro Hotel truly made me feel like I was staying with family.   I give them 5 stars.
