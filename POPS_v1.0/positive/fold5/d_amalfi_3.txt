The Amalfi is a great place to stay in Chicago -- the location is excellent for the price. You can walk to many sites from the hotel! The rooms are large and most importantly clean, and the service is excellent. The awesome double shower nozzle is amazing. Check-in was a breeze and my room was ready and waiting. The hotel provides many great features such as a fitness room and wireless Internet service. The hotel has great food-- breakfast and the cocktails were fantastic! I will definitely come back to this hotel the next time I visit Chicago.
