I was looking for something that wouldn't bust my budget but would still put me in the heart of the action, luckily I found the Intercontinental. My husband and I had a lot of things we wanted to do in town so I relied heavily on the concierge and advice from the staff. They let me know just what places to avoid. When we weren't enjoying the sights, we were cozy in our clean, quiet and tastefully decorated room. I feel we got our money's worth for the size of the room. Each day our room felt fresh and attended to. I would gladly stay here again.
