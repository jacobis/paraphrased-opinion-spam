The Palmer House Hilton is one of the best hotels the Chicago has to offer.  It's in a great location, right off State Street, so if you're looking to check out museums, shopping  and different restaurants, this hotel is a great pick as a home base.  Public transportation is available as well if you want to venture a little further from the hotel. The staff was awesome, very friendly, helpful and ready to accommodate your needs. Our room wonderful, dark and quiet, (we had a great night's sleep) very comfortable - plus there is a small fridge in the room filled with drinks if you get thristy in the middle of the night!   The lobby is a great place just to hang out and have a drink (it's stunning!)and the hotel provides a nice continental breakfast in the mornings.  I highly recommend this hotel as a go to place when visiting Chicago.
