Located conveniently close to the Soldier's Stadium and the Art Insitiute, this hotel had a reasonable price for a great room. Many restaurants were near by and there was a Starbucks in the lobby. We just had to upgrade to a suite with how affordable it was. The enormous sized suite included a living room, dining room and kitchen/wet bar area. The Bathrooms were well maintained and included lovely soaps and robes. Beds and linens were excellent as well. The service and amenities were great as well. The room service was quick with amazing food, the pool area was clean, and the workout area was clean as well. We had a light bulb replaced that went out and maintenance was there in a flash. All staff were friendly as well. We will definitely return. I would recommend this hotel to anyone interested in coming to Chicago.
