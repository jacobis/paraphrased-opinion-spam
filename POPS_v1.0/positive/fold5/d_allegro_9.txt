I stayed at the Allegro for a business trip in June. First off I would like to state that I booked my room with trivago.com and got great deal at just $75 a night. I chose the hotel mainly because of its close proximity to a wide variety of entertainment and where I was working while there. A lot of people here are complaining about the noise from outside their rooms, saying things like "the walls are thin" or "lots of street-noise". I'm not able to make such complaints as any sound I could hear from outside was negligible. The food provided by the room service was phenomenal and the staff was a dream team. Everyone working there was definitely on their A-game. The rooms are decent sized but it would have been nice to have a bigger bathroom, but in their defense the bathrooms were well maintained and accentuated. All in all I would give this Hotel my 4.5 out of 5. I have never given a 5 out of 5 rating, if that tells you anything.
