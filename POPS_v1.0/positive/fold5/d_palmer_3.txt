My husband and I went to Chicago last weekend for a much needed, short retreat.  We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton.  This hotel did not disappoint.  Our room was well-worth the cost with its Queen bed, down comforter, robes and plush towels.  In addition to offering lunch and dinner, a full buffet breakfast was offered at the Lockwood restaurant, which is located in the hotel.  There are many tourist attractions that are located within walking distance of the hotel, which was really nice, but if you do wish to use your own car (or a rental), the hotel offers a valet service as well.  Overall, the hotel staff was very helpful, friendly and efficient upon check-in, during our stay and with our check-out service.  We will definitely be coming back to stay at the Palmer House Hilton!
