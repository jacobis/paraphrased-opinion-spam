The intercontinental hotel is the perfect getaway for anyone who wants to get lost in the city. It has all the amenities that are necessary and is a comfortable place to stay while on vacation in Chicago. It is walking distance from Millennium Park, the Magnificent Mile, Chicago River, and across from the Wrigley Building. Additionally, it is super close to all of the museums and aquarium and of course, Navy Pier. I would definitely recommend this place on the basis of location. So convenient from everything! Although the room was a bit smaller than I expected, it was cozy and refined in taste. The room was nicely decorated and made us feel like we were actually on a vacation. A bit of home away from home with that luxury resort feeling. However, there was no view from our room - only a view of the wall from the hotel. But how can I complain when we are so close to all of the Chicago sights? The staff accommodated us in every way possible. They helped us in finding fine dining options that were affordable and unique to the city and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable during our stay here. Truly a great service to anyone staying here for vacation. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this hotel and in the city all thanks to intercontinental hotel. I recommend this hotel and highly think that anyone who needs a place to stay should stay here. Great location, great staff, affordable, and well done rooms. 5/5 stars!!
