I was in town on a business trip for a training conference. I took a chance, and book my hotel online with the Intercontinental, and let's just say, the hotel surpassed my expectations. The hotel was located on Chicago's iconic Magnificant Mile, which is known for it's restaurants, and not to mention shopping. The hotel staff was polite, and efficient, to perfection. I would be willing to go out on a limb and say that this hotel is one of th best hotel's in Chicago. Upon checking in, we were tatek to our room, which I found to be extremely clean, and fresh smelling. The main areas of the hotel were well designed, and welcoming to the guests. The main areas of the hotel did not disappoint as well. We found the areas to be modernly designed, which went with the overall ambiance of the hotel. The staff was helpful with whatever needs, and dare I say items or information that I requested. This hotel, combined with the location, as well as the fine dining restaurants, coupled with fabulous shopping stores, is right where you want to be, where the action is. I highly recommend the Intercontinental hotel if you are looking for a great hotel to stay at. I will however warn, that the hotel is a bit on the pricey side. However, the amenities that the hotel provides, as well as the location, in my opinion makes this hotel well worth the money. I suggest you give the hotel a try, you will not be disappointed!
