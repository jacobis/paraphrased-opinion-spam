I recently stayed at the Allegro for a business trip and I cam away very impressed.  The staff was extremely helpful and gave me advice in how to get around the area. The room is somewhat small, but it is clean. I also couldn't hear any noise from any of the rooms which was great considering it was a weekend and the hotel was full.  I ate my dinner in the hotel restaurant and was pleasantly surprised how generous the portions were considering the price.  The breakfast was also excellent.  I had a little time to kill the next day so I wondered around the area near the hotel.  There is a coffee shop nearby, the city hall is next door and it is only a short walk to the pier.  Overall, thumbs up.
