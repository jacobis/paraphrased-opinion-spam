This hotel was amazing.  It's right in the heart of downtown Chicago so we were close to everything.  The sights were easy to get to via walking and taxi.  The price of the hotel sealed the deal.  It was wonderful to not break the budget just to stay here.  The hotel room was clean, comfortable, and beautiful and the wifi worked perfect!  Definitely would stay here again!!!
