The Allegro is a great place to stay if you are visiting the Chicago area.  I have pets, and it's a rare to find such a nice place that allows them.  The location is great; quiet yet easy access to the loop or shopping areas. Our room was quite spacious with a great bed and large bathroom.  Try to arrive by 5, as they have a great wine reception from 5 to 6 which is a great way to start an evening in Chicago. Definitely will go back if I find myself in Chicago again.
