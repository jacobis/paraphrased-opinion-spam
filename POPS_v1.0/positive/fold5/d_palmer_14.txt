The Hilton Palmer Hotel is an excellent choice when visiting Chicago. The rooms are spacious enough to accommodate our needs, and having two bathrooms is quite convenient when getting ready to go out. It is conveniently located near several different attractions:  museums, restaurants, concert halls, etc. They offer free continental breakfast, and there are refreshments and snacks provided at no additional cost throughout the day, as well as items for purchase.  The hotel has recently been renovated, and some very nice upgrades have been made including new chairs and tables plama televisions. We are very pleased with the service and amenities ; we would stay again.
