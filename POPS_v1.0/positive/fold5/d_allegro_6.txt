We booked this hotel for our trip to Chicago and when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised. The room we booked was large and had a comfortable bed and great decor with very clean and proper surroundings. The hotel was located near many attractions so we were able to see a good amount of what the city had to offer with no problem at all. The hotel had a great restaurant and bar that served amazing breakfasts and drinks, the staff were always quite friendly. Overall we had a great time during our stay at this hotel and had such a great impression that we will come back next time we are in town.
