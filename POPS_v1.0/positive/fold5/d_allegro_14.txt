I really loved staying at this hotel, because its so close to downtown Chicago where there is always something exciting to do. The rooms are a little on the small side, but the beds are really clean and comfortable, and the hotel is totally pet friendly.  They welcomed our dog with her very own gift bag filled with goodies, and she even got her name on a blackboard for pet guests!  Although I wouldn't recommend taking the concierge up on his advice for restaurant choices, since they were mostly mediocre, I did love that the hotel offered us a choice between free drinks or breakfast.
