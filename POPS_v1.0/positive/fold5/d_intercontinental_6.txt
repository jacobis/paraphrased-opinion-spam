I visited this hotel through a recommendation and it did not fall short of expectations.  The view is amazing from the historic tower.  The service was excellent and very helpful including the door and check in staff, the bar staff, and bell staff.  The location is perfect, the rooms are spacious and very clean, my overall experience is one that I would do over anytime.  This is now one of my top recommended hotels for anyone I know travelling.
