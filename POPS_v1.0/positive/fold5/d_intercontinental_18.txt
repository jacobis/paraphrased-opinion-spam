We stayed here at this hotel for 3 nights and the first thing we noticed when we checked in was how beautiful and modern the room was. I really felt like we got a great deal for out money. The location was also really great. It was very easy and convenient to get to the tourist spots we wanted to check out from the hotel. There were lots of restaurants and shops nearby  as well which was a huge plus. Throughout our stay, I was amazed at how courteous and helpful the staff was. It really made our stay much more comfortable.
