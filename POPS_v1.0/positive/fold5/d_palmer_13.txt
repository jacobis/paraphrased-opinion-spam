I stayed at the hotel for one night on a walk in basis, and the experience was great. The staff was friendly and they accommodated my needs for a great price. The room itself was clean, and had a very modern feel to it. The hotel was located near plenty of restaurants and there were nice local spots to hang out at--theaters, bars, galleries, etc. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to have a great experience for a good price.
