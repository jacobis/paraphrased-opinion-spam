This is a magnificent hotel on the Magnificent Mile! I was attending a training conference in Chicago and that is the reason why I booked a room. We stayed at the Intercontinental which has a wonderful location and service from staff. We booked two rooms opposite each other for 6 nights. The reviews on Trip Advisor were right, it was a great trip! Thank you for giving us the opportunity to stay there.
