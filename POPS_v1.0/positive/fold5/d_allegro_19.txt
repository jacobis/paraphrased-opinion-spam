One of my favorite hotels to stay at when I am in Chicago is the Allegro. Since it was built in an old theatre the room sizes aren't all equal, but that just gives it character and I don't mind a smaller room when it's as affordable and beautiful as the rooms are at Allegro. The location is close enough to get to as many attractions as you could want to visit in downtown Chicago, but sometimes I just want to stay in the hotel because they really know how to help you relax. There's a spa and a complimentary wine hour every afternoon, and the staff is super helpful and accommodating with whatever you might need. Overall it's a very classy, wonderful hotel that can add that extra luxury to your trip.
