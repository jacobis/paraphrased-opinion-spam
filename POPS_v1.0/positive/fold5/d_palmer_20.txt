My husband and I just spend a wonderful weekend at the beautiful Palmer House. In addition to being a great value for the price, the location is wonderful, as it is very close to Soldier's Stadium, the Art Institute and the Berghoff. There's even a Starbucks in the lobby! Not only did we get a great price for our room, but we also were offered the opportunity to upgrade to a suite upon our arrival. The suite was huge and the furnishings beautiful, clearly they have recently renovated. The basic living room, dining room and kitchen/wet bar area was arranged in a contemporary open-plan concept in large room. We only need one bedroom, but we could have added up to three, using of connecting doors. All rooms were spotlessly clean, comfortable and smelled great. We loved the room's amenities - premium soaps, complementary robes, comfortable beds with quality linens and lots of large closets, We ordered room service, it was fast very fast, the server was friendly, and the food was delicious. We were pleased to get these accommodations because while the hotel is spacious, it has been sold out for several weeks. The Palmer House is a lovely hotel and a great value. I would definitely recommend the Palmer House to anyone interested in seeing Chicago.
