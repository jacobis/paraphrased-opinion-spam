I can honestly compare staying at the Palmer house to staying comfortably at home with personal services offered by an assistant and a butler. I was super impressed upon arrival with the friendliest staff to greet me and the magnificent decor of the hotel. I felt like a celebrity. As I was checking in I was offered an upgrade from a full size bed to a queen, free of charge! The restaurant located inside of the hotel was elegant and the food was tasteful. Every morning I indulged in the buffet style breakfast but you also have the option to personalize your order as well. Another great perk was the prime location which made it easy to get to from the nearby airport. I mean, who wants to take the longest cab ride ever to get to your destination after travels. Additionally it was a bonus to be about 20 minutes from the nearby strip that offered shopping and dining. I would recommend checking online for deal prices but definitely worth the stay for the refreshing all around services provided.
